AB Aging in water of a TiO2-based nanocomposite used in sunscreen cosmetics
   has been studied as a function of light and time. It consisted initially
   in a TiO2 core, coated with Al(OH)(3) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
   layers. Size measurement, coating alteration, and surface charge were
   followed by laser diffraction, TEM/EDS, ICP-AES and electrophoretic
   mobility measurement.
   The nanocomposite rapidly underwent progressive dispersion in the
   aqueous phase, enabled by the dissolution of the PDMS layer. A stable
   suspension of colloidal byproducts from 50 to 700 nm in size was formed.
   Their positively charged Al(OH)(3) surface was evidenced with an
   isoelectric point around 7-8, controlling the dispersion stability. The
   critical coagulation concentrations measured with NaCl and CaCl2 was 2 x
   10(-2) and 8 x 10(-3) M respectively. The presence of natural organic
   matter affected the colloidal stability according to the NOM/byproduct
   ratio. A 2 wt% ratio favored bridging flocculation, whereas a 20 wt%
   ratio induced sterical stabilization. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB A series of polyelectrolytes with controlled molecular weight, a narrow
   chain-length distribution, and systematic structural differences were
   synthesized using atom-transfer radical polymerization and investigated
   as stabilizers for magnetite nanoparticles in aqueous suspensions.
   Structural differences include the degree of polymerization, the chain
   architecture, and the identity of the charged functional unit. The
   synthesized polymers are sulfonated poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), a
   block copolymer of the former with poly(n-butyl methacrylate).
   poly(sodium styrene sulfonate), poly(sodium acrylate), and poly(sodium
   vinylphosphonate). The colloidal stability is assessed by measuring the
   fraction of particles, based on turbidity, that sediment alter a period
   or time at increasing ionic strength. Sedimentation results are
   complimented by dynamic light scattering determinations of the
   hydrodynamic diameter of the particles that remain suspended. When
   adsorption and sedimentation are conducted at high pH, poly(sodium
   acrylate) and poly(sodium vinylphosphonate) yield the most stable
   suspensions because of their strong coordinative interactions with the
   iron oxide surface. At tow pH, the polymers that retain pendant negative
   charges (each of the sulfonated polymers) yield high stable fractions at
   all ionic strengths investigated up to 100 mM (NaCl), whereas
   polyelectrolytes that become protonated with decreasing pH, poly(sodium
   acrylate) and poly(sodium vinylphosphonate). lose their stabilizing
   capacity even at low ionic strengths. The chain-length distribution
   profoundly alters a polymer's stabilization tendencies. Two poly(sodium
   acrylate) samples with the same number-average molecular weight hut
   widely different chain-length distributions proved to have opposite
   tendencies, with the polydisperse sample being a good stabilizer and the
   low polydispersity one being a strong flocculant. This investigation
   provides guidelines for the design or polymeric stabilizers for
   magnetite nanoparticles according to the pH and ionic strength of the
   intended application.

AB The ecological risk assessment of chemicals including nanoparticles is
   based on the determination of adverse effects on organisms and on the
   environmental concentrations to which biota are exposed. The aim of this
   work was to better understand the behavior of nanoparticles in the
   environment, with the ultimate goal of predicting future exposure
   concentrations in water. We measured the concentrations and particle
   size distributions of CeO2 nanoparticles in algae growth medium and
   deionized water in the presence of various concentrations and two types
   of natural organic matter (NOM). The presence of natural organic matter
   stabilizes the CeO2 nanoparticles in suspension. In presence of NOM, up
   to 88% of the initially added CeO2 nanoparticles remained suspended in
   deionized water and 41% in algae growth medium after 12 d of settling.
   The adsorbed organic matter decreases the zeta potential from about -15
   mV to -55 mV. This reduces aggregation by increased electrostatic
   repulsion. The particle diameter, pH, electric conductivity and NOM
   content shows significant correlation with the fraction of CeO2
   nanoparticles remaining in suspension. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Mercury is a global contaminant of concern due to its transformation by
   microorganisms to form methylmercury, a toxic species that accumulates
   in biological tissues. The effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   isolated from natural waters on reactions between mercury(II) (Hg) and
   sulfide (S(-II)) to form HgS((s)) nanoparticles across a range of Hg and
   S(-II) concentrations was investigated. Hg was equilibrated with DOM,
   after which S(-II) was added. Dissolved Hg (Hg(aq)) was periodically
   quantified using ultracentrifugation and chemical analysis following the
   addition of S(-II). Particle size and identity were determined using
   dynamic light scattering and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. S(-II)
   reacts with Hg to form 20 to 200 nm aggregates consisting of 1-2 nm
   HgS((s)) subunits that are more structurally disordered than
   metacinnabar in the presence of 2 x 10(-9) to 8 x 10(-6) M Hg and 10 (mg
   C) L(-1) DOM. Some of the HgS((s)) nanoparticle aggregates are
   subsequently dissolved by DOM and (re)precipitated by S(-II) over
   periods of hours to clays. At least three fractions of Hg-DOM species
   were observed with respect to reactivity toward S(-II): 0.3 mu mol
   reactive Hg per mmol C (60 percent), 0.1 mu mol per mmol C (20 percent)
   that are kinetically hindered, and another 0.1 mu mol Ha per mmol C (20
   percent) that are inert to reaction with S(-II). Following an initial
   S(-II)-driven precipitation of HgS((s)), HgS((s)) was dissolved by DOM
   or organic sulfur compounds. HgS((s)) formation during this second phase
   was counterintuitively favored by lower S(-II) concentrations,
   suggesting surface association of DOM moieties that are less capable of
   dissolving HgS((s)). DOM partially inhibits HgS((s)) formation and
   mediates reactions between Hg and S(-II) such that HgS((s)) is
   susceptible to dissolution. These findings indicate that Hg
   accessibility to microorganisms could be controlled by kinetic
   (intermediate) species in the presence of S(-II) and DOM, undermining
   the premise that equilibrium Ha species distributions should correlate
   to the extent or rate of Hg methylation in soils and sediments.

AB Nano boron is a promising new propellant being considered for military
   and civilian applications; however, the impact of its release on the
   environment is largely not known. The early stage aggregation kinetics
   of boron nanoparticles was investigated in the presence of two kinds of
   natural organic matter Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) and sodium
   alginate by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). The addition of SRHA caused the boron nanoparticles to
   stabilize and resulted in (1) decreased attachment efficiency for the
   reaction-controlled regime and (2) an increase in the critical
   coagulation concentration, in CaCl(2) and MgCl(2) solutions. The
   increase in the electrostatic repulsion is suggested as a main cause of
   the induced stabilization as indicated by the electrophoretic mobility
   measurements. Similar behavior was observed in the presence of alginate
   and MgCl(2). However, the attachment efficiency kept increasing in the
   presence of CaCl2 and alginate with the increase in the electrolyte
   concentration and was greater than unity at >4 mM CaCl(2). The
   destabilization was attributed to bridging of the nanoparticles by the
   alginate-Ca(2+) system. Results from this study suggest that various NOM
   and electrolytes play significant and differing roles in the aggregation
   of boron nanoparticles in natural aquatic environments. (C) 2010

AB Studies of the fate and transport of engineered nanomaterials are
   invaluable in predicting environmental impact, bioavailability, and
   toxicity. We report on the influence of humic and fulvic acids (models
   of natural organic matter) on the phase transfer of organic-capped CdSe
   quantum dots (QDs) from hexane to water. QDs capped with
   tri-n-octylphosphine oxide, tetradecylphosphonic acid, and oleic acid,
   which were otherwise insoluble in water, were transferred into aqueous
   solutions of humic substances (HS) (Suwannee River humic acid and fulvic
   acid standards) within 1-10 days after mixing. Phase transfer was
   characterized by infrared and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, emission
   spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, electron microscopy, and
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Phase-transferred QDs were
   intact and temporarily stabilized by HS. On longer timescales, Cd(2+)
   leached into aqueous solution. Our data suggest that two mechanisms
   promote the phase transfer of QD-HS agglomerates: (1) an overcoating
   mechanism involving dispersion interactions between non-polar moieties
   of HS and hydrocarbon chains of organic capping groups and (2) a
   coordinative mechanism involving displacement of capping groups by Lewis
   basic functionalities of HS. The structure of the capping group of QDs
   influenced the relative contributions of the two mechanisms and the
   extent to which Cd(2+) leached into water. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Mineral sulfide colloids and nanoparticles are important for the aquatic
   fate and transport of toxic metals such as zinc and mercury in anaerobic
   environments. The persistence of metal sulfides in the colloidal form is
   likely to depend on surface interactions with dissolved natural organic
   matter. In this work, we investigated the sorption of cysteine and
   serine on ZnS and HgS particles and the implications for colloidal
   stability. These amino acids were used as model compounds for small
   molecular weight natural organic acids. Cysteine was found to increase
   colloidal stability by adsorbing to particle surfaces and modifying the
   surface potential of the particles. In contrast, serine did not adsorb
   in appreciable amounts and as a consequence, did not appear to alter
   surface properties and particle attachment efficiencies. The pH of the
   aqueous phase was another critical component for controlling aggregation
   kinetics of cysteine-coated ZnS particles. Colloidal stability was
   promoted at pH values greater than 7 due to deprotonation of functional
   groups on the mineral surface and sorbed cysteine molecules. These
   results indicate that specific surface coordination of thiol-containing
   natural organic acids is important for the colloidal stability of ZnS,
   HgS, and other metal sulfides in water. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Upon release of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) into the subsurface
   environment, their fate and transport and hence their potential
   environmental and public health impacts will largely depend on how
   stable these NPs are as suspended particles in the natural environment.
   In this study, we systematically examine the effect of humic acid (HA)
   on surface charge status and aggregation potential of magnetite
   (Fe(3)O(4)) NPs, selected as a model for metal oxide NPs, over a wide
   range of solution pH and ionic strength. Through zeta potential (ZP)
   measurements, we found that HA can adsorb to magnetite particles hence
   modifying their surface charge status. At low loadings, the presence of
   HA can induce a shift in the point zero of charge of due to partial
   neutralization of the positive charges on magnetite NPs. At high
   loadings, however. HA is capable of completely cover magnetite particles
   giving rise to a suspension ZP profile similar to its own (observed in
   presence of 20 mg L(-1) HA). These impacts on surface charge correspond
   well with the observed aggregation behaviors in the absence and presence
   of HA. From the dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements, fast
   aggregation, which is independent of solution chemistry, took place when
   the pH is close to the point zero charge (PZC) and the ionic strength is
   above the critical coagulation concentration (CCC). At high ionic
   strength, a small dose (2 mg L(-1)) of HA stabilized the NPs' suspension
   significantly. This stabilization effect is substantially enhanced with
   increasing HA concentration. The calculated DLVO
   (Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek) interaction energy profiles, using
   experimentally determined values of Hamaker constant, adequately support
   the experimental observations. The DLVO analysis further reveals the
   possible presence of secondary energy minima and the possibility of
   deaggregation of magnetite agglomerates. The complexation of HA-NPs and
   the HA effects on NPs aggregations were confirmed by atomic force
   microscope (AFM) observations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Assessing the environmental transport and fate of manufactured
   nanoparticles (NPs) and potential exposure risks requires models for
   predicting attachment of NPs coated with organic macromolecules in
   porous media. The objective of this study was to determine the
   properties of coated nanoparticles that control their attachment
   behavior. Deposition data for a variety of nanoparticles with different
   types of anionic organic coatings, including natural organic matter
   (NOM)-coated latex and hematite nanoparticles, and
   poly(styrenesulfonate)-, carboxymethylcellulose-, and
   polyaspartate-coated hematite and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (80
   data points), were used to develop an empirical correlation between
   measurable NP properties and their sticking coefficient (a) under a
   variety of electrolyte conditions and flow velocities. Available
   semiempirical correlations used to predict the attachment efficiency of
   electrostatically stabilized (uncoated) NPs overestimate the attachment
   efficiency of nanoparticles coated with NOM or synthetic
   polyelectrolytes because the correlations neglect electrosteric
   repulsions and the decreased friction afforded by such coatings that can
   inhibit attachment to surfaces. Adding a dimensionless parameter
   (N(LEK)) representing steric repulsions and the decreased friction force
   afforded by adsorbed NOM or anionic polyelectrolytes in the correlation
   significantly improves the correlation. This establishes the importance
   of including the adsorbed NOM- or polyelectrolyte layer properties for
   estimating the attachment efficiency of NPs in the environment. The form
   of NLEK suggests that limiting unintended transport and exposure to NPs
   could be achieved by using coatings with the smallest adsorbed mass and
   polymer density, shortest extended layer thickness, and largest
   molecular weight that would still afford the desired functionality of
   the coating.

AB Low molecular weight organic acids comprise an important pool of
   reactive ligands in aquatic systems. These acids readily bind to
   nano-sized mineral particles and thereby strongly influence a particle's
   physicochemical behavior. Predicting this influence requires the
   integration of molecular-level details that control surface complexation
   mechanisms and structures with macro-scale observations of mineral
   colloid behavior. We report on the aggregation kinetics of nano-sized
   hematite in the presence of fumaric acid and maleic acid, which are
   naturally occurring dicarboxylic acids of similar size and structure.
   Our results indicate that the structure and orientation of the adsorbed
   dianion at the hematite surface, not the adsorption mechanism, defines
   the resulting effect. Maleate, which directs both carboxyl groups to the
   surface in the form of inner- and outer-sphere surface complexes,
   enhances colloidal stability. Fumarate, however, which binds to the
   hematite surface as an outer-sphere complex with just one carboxyl group
   only slightly influenced particle stability. This outcome suggests that
   subtle differences in the structure of adsorbed acids produce important
   differences in the physicochemical behavior of particles in dilute
   aquatic systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) is used for groundwater remediation.
   Freshly synthesized bare, i.e. uncoated NZVI is bactericidal at low mg/L
   concentration, but the impact of surface modifiers and aging (partial
   oxidation) on its bactericidal properties have not been determined. Here
   we assess the effect that adsorbed synthetic polymers and natural
   organic matter (NOM) and aging (partial oxidation) have on the
   bactericidal properties of NZVI to the gram-negative bacterium,
   Escherichia coli. Exposure to 100 mg/L of bare NZVI with 28% Fe(0)
   content resulted in a 2.2-log inactivation after 10 min and a 5.2-log
   inactivation after 60 min. Adsorbed poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS),
   poly(aspartate) (PAP), or NOM on NZVI with the same Fe(0) content
   significantly decreased its toxicity, causing less than 0.2-log
   inactivation after 60 min. TEM images and heteroaggregation studies
   indicate that bare NZVI adheres significantly to cells and that the
   adsorbed polyelectrolyte or NOM prevents adhesion, thereby decreasing
   NZVI toxicity. The 1.8-log inactivation observed for bare NZVI with 7%
   Fe(0) content was lower than the 5.2-log inactivation using NZVI with
   28% Fe(0) after 1 h; however, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
   after 24 h was 5 mg/L regardless of Fe(0) content. The MIC of PSS, PAP,
   and NOM coated NZVI were much higher: 500 mg/L, 100 mg/L, and 100 mg/L,
   respectively. But the MIC was much lower than the typical injection
   concentration used in remediation (10 g/L). Complete oxidation of Fe(0)
   in NZVI under aerobic conditions eliminated its bactericidal effects.
   This study indicates that polyelectrolyte coatings and NOM will mitigate
   the toxicity of NZVI for exposure concentrations below 0.1 to 0.5 g/L
   depending on the coating and that aged NZVI without Fe(0) is relatively
   benign to bacteria.

   concentration tested (1 mM NaCl) due to the interactions between various
   surfaces. The CCC of ZnO was found to be a function of pH; the CCC
   increased significantly as the pH was further away from the point of
   zero charge. Natural organic matter (NOM) was found to substantially
   hinder the aggregation of both types of ZnO particles (above 10 mg/L for
   Me ZnO and above 1 mg/L for Mk ZnO). A Langmuir adsorption model was
   used to describe the NOM to ZnO nanoparticle adsorption isotherms. To
   our knowledge, this is the first study to report the effect of particle
   morphology on nanoparticle aggregation, which outlines the importance of
   accounting morphology into environmental transport assessment of
   nanoparticles. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is a pressing need for information on the mobility of
   nanoparticles in the complex aqueous matrices found in realistic
   environmental conditions. We dispersed three different metal oxide
   nanoparticles (TiO(2), ZnO and CeO(2)) in samples taken from eight
   different aqueous media associated with seawater, lagoon, river, and
   groundwater, and measured their electrophoretic mobility, state of
   aggregation, and rate of sedimentation. The electrophoretic mobility of
   the particles in a given aqueous media was dominated by the presence of
   natural organic matter (NOM) and ionic strength, and independent of pH.
   NOM adsorbed onto these nanoparticles significantly reduces their
   aggregation, stabilizing them under many conditions. The transition from
   reaction to diffusion limited aggregation occurs at an electrophoretic
   mobility from around -2 to -0.8 mu m s(-1) V(-1) cm. These results are
   key for designing and interpreting nanoparticle ecotoxicity studies in
   various environmental conditions.

AB Many important aspects of nanosilver behavior are influenced by the
   ionic activity associated with the particle suspension, including
   antibacterial potency, eukaryotic toxicity, environmental release, and
   particle persistence. The present study synthesizes pure, ion-free,
   citrate-stabilized nanosilver (nAg) colloids as model systems, and
   measures their time-dependent release of dissolved silver using
   centrifugal ultrafiltration and atomic absorption spectroscopy. Ion
   release is shown to be a cooperative oxidation process requiring both
   dissolved dioxygen and protons. It produces peroxide intermediates, and
   proceeds to complete reactive dissolution under some conditions. Ion
   release rates increase with temperature in the range 0-37 degrees C, and
   decrease with increasing pH or addition of humic or fulvic acids. Sea
   salts have only a minor effect on dissolved silver release. Silver
   nanoparticle surfaces can adsorb Ag(+), so even simple colloids contain
   three forms of silver: Ag(0) solids, free Ag+ or its complexes, and
   surface-adsorbed Ag(+). Both thermodynamic analysis and kinetic
   measurements indicate that Ag(0) nanciparticles will not be persistent
   in realistic environmental compartments containing dissolved oxygen. An
   empirical kinetic law is proposed that reproduces the observed effects
   of dissolution time, pH, humic/fulvic acid content, and temperature
   observed here in the low range of nanosilver concentration most relevant
   for the environment.

AB Sorption of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) to natural organic
   matter (NOM) is an important process that affects the transport,
   transformation, bioavailability, and fate of HOCs in the environment.
   Manufactured nanoparticles (NPs) such as nano-oxides will inevitably
   enter the environment in the processes of their production, transfer,
   and use and could be coated by the ubiquitous NOM. Thus, sorption of
   HOCs to NOM in the environment could be affected by the NP interactions
   with NOM. Furthermore, the toxicity of nano-oxides could be increased
   due to the adsorbed HOCs. Therefore, sorption of phenanthrene by
   nano-Al(2)O(3) coated with humic acid (HA) was examined in this study to
   explore the possible effect of nanoparticles (NPs) on the environmental
   behavior of HOCs and the potential environmental and health risks of
   NPs.
   Four HAs were sequentially extracted with 0.1 mol/L NaOH from a peat
   soil. HAs, nano-Al(2)O(3), and HA-coated nano-Al(2)O(3) were
   characterized by techniques such as elemental analysis, solid-state
   (13)C NMR, N(2) surface area analysis, and zeta potential measurement.
   Adsorption isotherms of HAs by nano-Al(2)O(3) and phenanthrene by HAs
   and HA-coated nano-Al(2)O(3) were obtained using a batch equilibration
   technique at 25 +/- 1A degrees C. HA concentrations were measured by
   total organic carbon analysis. Phenanthrene concentrations were measured
   by liquid scintillation counting.
   The adsorption maxima of HAs by nano-Al(2)O(3) was one order of
   magnitude higher than that by soil inorganic minerals. Phenanthrene
   isotherms of HA-coated nano-Al(2)O(3) were more nonlinear than that of
   their respective bulk HAs. Concentration-dependent organic
   carbon-normalized sorption coefficients (K' (oc)) of phenanthrene by
   HA-coated nano-Al(2)O(3) were lower than those for their respective bulk
   HAs, especially at relatively high concentrations.
   Isotherm nonlinearity of phenanthrene could be interpreted by a
   combination of partitioning accompanied by linear isotherm with
   adsorption accompanied by nonlinear isotherm. HA conformation changes
   during their adsorption on nano-Al(2)O(3) could play an important role
   in phenanthrene sorption and were responsible for higher nonlinearity of
   phenanthrene isotherms and lower phenanthrene K' (oc) on the adsorbed
   HAs than their respective bulk HAs. Adsorption of HA on nano-Al(2)O(3)
   would form a more condensed HA state with higher
   pi-polarity/polarizability and lower partitioning affinity than the
   respective bulk HA, leading to an increase of relative contribution of
   adsorption to the total sorption and more nonlinear phenanthrene
   isotherms in the adsorbed HA due to the increase in phenanthrene
   adsorption affinity and decrease in phenanthrene partitioning affinity.
   Adsorption of HA on nano-Al(2)O(3) was much higher than that on soil
   oxide minerals and could form a more condensed HA state with higher
   pi-polarity/polarizability and lower partitioning affinity than the bulk
   HA, causing the significant difference in phenanthrene sorption between
   the adsorbed HA and the respective bulk HA. Therefore, once released in
   the environment, NPs such as nano-Al(2)O(3) will strongly alter the
   environmental transport, fate, and bioavailability of HOCs and could be
   potentially more toxic due to the adsorbed toxic chemicals.
   Due to the high adsorption of HA on nano-Al(2)O(3) and its significant
   effect on phenanthrene sorption, interactions of NOM with nano-oxides
   and their mechanistic relations with NOM conformation changes and HOC
   sorption merit further research. In addition, due to the higher sorption
   of phenanthrene on the HA-coated nano-Al(2)O(3) than the pure
   counterpart, the effect of NOM and HOCs on the ecotoxicity of NPs should
   be addressed in the future.

AB The colloidal stability of three structurally different humic acid
   (HA)-coated Al2O3 nanoparticles (HAs-Al2O3 NPs) was studied in the
   presence of Ca2+. HAs were obtained after sequential extractions of
   Amherst Peat Soil, Highly polar HAl-coated Al2O3 NPs exhibited strong
   aggregation in the presence of Ca2+. HA3 and HA7-coated NPs showed
   weaker aggregation due to their increased aliphaticity and low polarity.
   HA7-Al2O3 NPs displayed the weakest aggregation behavior even at
   relatively high Ca2+ concentration. The inverse stability ratio (alpha =
   1/W) was the lowest for HA7-Al2O3 NPs, reflecting that strong steric
   stabilization enhanced colloidal stability. Atomic force microscopy
   (AFM) of pure Al2O3 NPs oil Ca(2+)saturated mica clearly demonstrated
   significant aggregation following classical
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) model for hard spheres. On the
   contrary, weakly polar HA fraction produced approximately 10 nm thick
   corona of adsorbed layer around each Al2O3 NP, thus stabilizing coated
   NP suspension through steric effect. Under alkaline conditions and at
   low ionic strength, adsorbed HA chains swelled, increasing their osmotic
   potential, which in turn resulted instabilization of the colloids.
   Inherent structural variations of natural organic matter (NOM) played a
   significant part in colloidal stability of the coated NPs. Thus,
   development of sterically stabilized NPs may have potential application
   for water remediation in marine and high salinity conditions.

AB The application of nanoparticles in the processes of making commercial
   products has increased in recent years due to their unique physical and
   chemical properties. With increasing amount of commercial nanoparticles
   released into nature, their fate and effects on the ecosystem and human
   health are of growing concern. This study investigated the stability and
   morphology of three metal oxide nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. The
   commercially available nanoparticles, TiO(2), ZnO, SiO(2), aggregated
   quickly into micrometer-size particles in aqueous solutions, which may
   not threaten human health. Their changes in morphology and
   characteristics were further examined by dynamic light scattering (DLS)
   method and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Among the several
   dispersion approaches, ultrasonication was found to be the most
   effective for disaggregating nanoparticles in water. For these three
   selected nanoparticles, ZnO could not remain stable in suspensions,
   presumably due to the dissolution of particles to form high
   concentration of ions, resulting in enhanced aggregation of particles.
   In addition, the existence of dissolved organic matters stabilized
   nanoparticles in lake water and wastewater for several hours in spite of
   the high concentration of cations in these real-water samples. The fate
   of metal oxide nanoparticles in natural water bodies would be determined
   by the type and concentration of cations and organic matters. Results
   obtained in this study revealed that the stability of nanoparticles
   changed under different aqueous conditions and so did their fate in the
   environment.

AB Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are becoming increasingly popular as
   antimicrobial agents in consumer goods with consequent risk to
   environmental health from discharges. Environmentally relevant fate and
   transport investigations are limited but essential to gain understanding
   towards bioavailability and toxicology. In this study, monodisperse 15
   nm citrate-stabilised Ag NPs were synthesised, characterised and then
   fractionated by flow field-flow fractionation (FIFFF) at environmentally
   relevant conditions (pH 5 or 8, presence of natural organic
   macromolecules (NOM) and presence of sodium or calcium). At low ionic
   strength, Ag NPs particle size increased as pH increased from 5 to 8.
   However, changing the ionic strength from 10(-3) to 10(-2) M Na
   increased instability of the Ag NPs, and loss of peak at pH 5 but in the
   presence of humic substance (HS), a reduction in NP size was seen, most
   likely due to a reduction in the diffuse layer. The presence of Ca(2+)
   ions, at the higher ionic strengths caused complete loss of the solution
   Ag NPs with or without HS, most likely due to aggregation. At the lower
   Ca(2+) ionic strength the Ag NPs were still unstable, but again, in the
   presence of HS the NPs were largely dispersed. The presence of HS
   improved stability of Ag NPs under these conditions by forming a Surface
   coating resulting in both steric and charge stabilisation. This work
   implies that Ag NPs could have long residence times in aquatic systems
   in the presence of HS potentially resulting in increased
   bioavailability. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Humic substances (HS) play an important role in the reactivity and
   transport of colloids in natural environments. In particular, the
   presence of fulvic acids (FA) in natural waters modifies the
   interactions between inorganic particles and biopolymers; and makes
   difficult to predict their stability with regard to aggregation
   processes. In this study, Brownian dynamics (BD) modeling is applied to
   quantify the interactions between negatively charged FA and (i) a
   positively charged inorganic particle and (ii) a rigid neutral
   polysaccharide in aqueous solutions. Hematite and schizophyllan are
   respectively used as model colloids. Modeling the adsorption of FA at
   the hematite particle surface and on the polysaccharide is based on van
   der Waals attractive forces and Electrostatic interactions. Possible
   applications of the model, however, are not restricted to this system
   and any interaction potential or colloidal particle can be considered.
   The competition between FA adsorption and FA homocoagulation in solution
   is studied as function of the solution ionic strength. Results show
   that, under the conditions used, the amount of adsorbed FA is largely
   controlled by the solution ionic strength. At low ionic strength the
   amount of adsorbed FA is limited by the electrostatic repulsion between
   FA at the colloid surfaces and FA monolayers are formed. By increasing
   the ionic strength the number of adsorbed FA is found to increase. At a
   sufficiently large ionic strength, however, FA coagulation in solution
   may strongly compete with FA adsorption at the hematite and
   polysaccharide surfaces. FA aggregates then adsorb at the colloid
   surfaces to form extended and porous structures. Results also suggest
   that FA adsorption and structure of the adsorbed layers are mainly
   driven by the complex interplay between Electrostatic attractive and
   repulsive interactions.

AB The fate and transport of diagnostic gold nanoparticles in surface
   waters would significantly depend on their interactions with humic
   substances, which are ubiquitously found in natural aquatic systems. The
   current study employs UV-visible absorbance and fluorescence
   spectroscopy to investigate the interactions of commercial humic acid
   (HA) with gold nanoparticles having a core size of 5 nm and coated with
   two different stabilizers, beta-D-glucose and citrate. Humic substances
   (HS) are fluorescent in nature, providing a unique probe of
   nanometer-scale morphological changes for interactions between these
   natural polyelectrolytes and water-soluble gold nanoparticles. Quenching
   of fluorescence intensity was observed with beta-D-glucose-coated gold
   nanoparticles, whereas an enhancement effect was noticed with the
   citrate-coated particles when mixed with HA having concentrations of 2
   and 8 ppm (surface waters typically may contain similar to 10 ppm HS).
   Examining the quenching and enhancement of fluorescence provides insight
   into the structural changes taking place at the coated gold
   nanoparticle-HA interface. The quenching behavior suggested ligand
   exchange due to nanometer-scale contact between the HA and
   beta-D-glucose-coated gold nanoparticles, whereas the enhancement effect
   with citrate particles would indicate overcoating, leading to increased
   transfer distances for fluorescence resonance energy transfer.

AB The formation of small and large molecular polyanionic coating on the
   surface of magnetite (Fe(3)O(4)) nanoparticles and their role in the
   stability enhancement of aqueous magnetic fluids are compared. Magnetite
   was synthesized and stabilized with citric (CA) and humic (HA) acids.
   The macromolecular HA, a notable fraction of the natural organic matter
   (NOM), contains mainly carboxylic groups similarly to the CA, and both
   acids are able to form surface complexes on the equivalent to Fe-OH
   sites of iron oxides. The pH-dependent charge state of particles and
   their aggregation were quantified, and the enhanced salt tolerance of
   stabilized systems was studied. The dynamic light scattering (DLS)
   method was used to characterize colloidal stability under different
   conditions. The average particle size and electrophoretic mobility were
   measured, and the electrolyte tolerance was tested in coagulation
   kinetic measurements. The colloidal stability of magnetite dispersions
   depends sensitively on the pH and the concentration of organic acids
   present. The trace amount of HA neutralizes the positive charges on
   magnetite surface under acidic condition only in part, and so it
   promotes the aggregation between the particles having both positive
   sites and negative humate patches on the surface. Above the adsorption
   saturation, the surface becomes completely covered causing the reversal
   of charge sign and overcharging of nanoparticles. The magnetite
   nanoparticles become stabilized in a way of combined steric and
   electrostatic effects. The thicker layer of macromolecular HA provides
   better electrosteric stability than that of CA coating. However, in the
   presence of either CA or HA, the dissolution of magnetite is enhanced
   due to the complexation of iron ions in the aqueous medium. (C) 2009

AB The stability of nanoparticles in aquatic environment plays an important
   role in determining their environmental implication and potential risk
   to human health. This research studied the impact of natural organic
   matter (NOM) and divalent cations (Ca(2+)) on the stability of
   engineered metal oxide nanoparticles (e.g. ZnO, NiO, TiO(2), Fe(2)O(3)
   and SiO(2)). When nanoparticles were present in neutral water, a
   relatively weak electrolyte concentration (0.01 M KCl) could result in
   their aggregation; however, with the addition of 1 mg/L NOM, the
   negative surface charge of nanoparticles increased significantly and
   therefore their propensity to aggregate is reduced. 4 mg/L NOM
   stabilized most nanoparticles by producing -30 mV or higher zeta
   potentials. On the other hand, the negative charge that NOM imparted to
   nanoparticles could be neutralized by divalent cations (calcium ions).
   0.04 M-0.06 M Ca(2+) induced the aggregation of NOM-coated
   nanoparticles. It should be noted that among all the studied
   nanoparticles, SiO(2) exhibited the unique stability due to its low NOM
   adsorption capacity and small Hamaker constant. SiO(2) remained stable
   no matter whether the solution contained NOM or Ca(2+). (C) 2009

AB Nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) particles have recently become subject
   of great interest in the field of groundwater remediation for their
   ability to treat a wide variety of organic and inorganic contaminants.
   However, the field application of this technology is strongly hindered
   by the lack of stability of NZVI water suspensions.
   This study demonstrates that highly concentrated NZVI slurries (15 g/L)
   can be stabilized for more than 10 days adding 6 g/L of xanthan gum
   biopolymer. Stability against aggregation and sedimentation was achieved
   in the range of ionic strength 6 x 10(-3)-12 mM and is mainly due to the
   formation of a viscous gel characterized by shear-thinning behaviour.

AB Column studies showed that the mobility of nanometer-sized
   zerovalentiron (nZVI) through granular media is greatly increased in the
   presence of natural organic matter (NOM). At NOM concentrations of 20
   mg/L or greater, the nZVI was highly mobile during transport experiments
   in 0.15-m long columns packed with medium sand. Below 20 mg/L NOM,
   mobility of the nZVI was less; however, even at 2 mg/L the nZVI showed
   significantly increased mobility compared to the no-NOM case.
   Spectrophotometric and aggregation studies of nZVI suspensions in the
   presence of NOM suggest that sorption of the NOM onto the nZVI,
   resulting in a reduced sticking coefficient may be the primary mechanism
   of enhanced mobility. Modeling the mobility of nZVI in porous media with
   filtration theory is challenging, but calibration of a simple model with
   experimental results from the column experiments reported here allows
   simulation of transport distances during injection. The simulation
   results show that the increased mobility due to NOM combined with the
   decrease in mobility due to decreased velocity with distance from an
   injection well could produce an injection zone that is wide enough to be
   useful for remediation but small enough to avoid reaching unwanted
   receptors.

AB The combined effect of pH and calcium on the interactions of nonozonated
   and ozonated natural organic matter (NOM) with nanoscale TiO2 was
   investigated. The approach included characterization of TiO2
   nanoparticles and NOM, extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO)
   modeling of NOM-TiO2 and NOM-NOM interactions, batch study on the NOM
   adsorption onto TiO2 surface, and bench-scale study on the treatment of
   NOM-containing feed waters using a hybrid process that combines
   ozonation and ultrafiltration with a 5 kDa ceramic (TiO2 surface)
   membrane. It was demonstrated that depending on pH and TiO2 loading, the
   adsorption of NOM species is controlled by either the availability of
   divalent cations or by preozonation of NOM. XDLVO surface energy
   analysis predicts NOM adsorption onto TiO2 in the ozone-controlled
   regime but not in the calcium-controlled regime. In both regimes,
   short-range NOM-NOM and NOM-TiO2 interactions were governed by acid-base
   and van der Waals forces, whereas the role of electrostatic forces was
   relatively insignificant. Ozonation increased the surface energy of NOM,
   contributing to the hydrophilic repulsion component of the NOM-NOM and
   NOM-TiO2 interactions. In the calcium-controlled regime, neither
   NOM-TiO2 nor NOM-NOM interaction controlled adsorption. Non-XDLVO
   interactions such as intermolecular bridging by calcium were
   hypothesized to be responsible for the observed adsorption behavior.
   Adsorption data proved to be highly predictive of the permeate flux
   performance.

AB The transport proper-des of titanium dioxide (anatase polymorph)
   nanoparticles encapsulated by carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) were
   evaluated as a function of changes in the solute chemical properties in
   clean quartz, amorphous aluminum, and iron hydroxide-coated sands. While
   pristine anatase TiO(2) nanoparticles (ANTNPs) were completely immobile,
   the presence of CMC significantly enhanced their mobility. The magnitude
   of the surface charge exhibited by the CMC-coated anatase TiO(2)
   nanoparticles (CMC-ANTNPs) significantly exceeded that of the uncoated
   ANTNPs, thereby leading to a negative surface charge over the pH range
   investigated (2-10). The mobility of CMC-ANTNPs was retarded by the
   presence of amorphous Fe and Al hydroxide, Na(+) (30 mM), and Ca(2+) (30
   mM). Removal of CMC-ANTNPs was more significant in the presence of
   either Ca(2+) or Fe-hydroxide. More retardation and incomplete
   breakthrough of the CMC-ANTNPs was observed in the mineral-coated sands.
   This is possibly due to an order of magnitude increase in the surface
   area of miner l-coated sands compared with the clean quartz sand grains
   and the potential for chelation between CMC bound to ANTNPs and Fe and
   Al hydroxides. Chemical-colloidal interactions such as chemicomplexation
   and ligand exchange were the most important factor controlling mobility
   of CMC-ANTNPs in mineral-coated sands.

AB Adsorption of natural organic matter (NOM) on nanoparticles (NPs) is
   important for evaluating their transport, transfer, and fate in the
   environment, which will also affect sorption of hydrophobic organic
   compounds (HOCs) by NPs and thereby potentially alter the toxicity of
   NPs and the fate, transport, and bioavailability of HOCs in the
   environment. Therefore, the adsorption behavior of humic acids (HA) by
   four types of nano-oxides (i.e., TiO(2), SiO(2), Al(2)O(3), and ZnO) was
   examined in this study to explore their interaction mechanisms using
   techniques including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and
   elemental, zeta potential, and surface area analyses. Adsorption of HA
   was observed on nanosized TiO(2), Al(2)O(3), and ZnO but not on
   nano-SiO(2). Furthermore, HA adsorption was pH-dependent. HA adsorption
   by nano-oxides was mainly induced by electrostatic attraction and ligand
   exchange between HA and nano-oxide surfaces. Surface hydrophilicity and
   negative charges of nano-oxides affected their adsorption of HA.
   However, the maxima of HA adsorption on nano-oxides were limited by the
   surface area of nano-oxides. HA phenolic OH and COOH groups were
   responsible for its ligand exchange with nano-TiO(2) and nano-ZnO(,)
   respectively, while either HA COOH or HA phenolic/aliphatic OH was
   responsible for its ligand exchange with nano-Al(2)O(3). HA adsorption
   decreased the micropore surface area of nano-oxides but not the external
   surface area because of the micropore blockage. HA adsorption also
   decreased the zeta potential of nano-oxides, indicating that HA-coated
   nano-oxides could be more easily dispersed and suspended and more stable
   in solution than uncoated ones because of their enhanced electrostatic
   repulsion.

AB Speciation of mercury(II) in the aquatic environment and coordination to
   natural organic matter (NOM) and sulfides governs the bioavailability
   and mobility of mercury in water and sediment. While previous studies on
   aqueous Hg(II) speciation have focused on competitive binding of
   dissolved species, the purpose of this study was to explore the
   potential for HgS nanoparticles that coprecipitate with NOM in solution.
   Dynamic light scattering was used to monitor the size of HgS colloids
   growing over time. The results indicated that humic substances decreased
   observed growth rates of particles and stabilized aggregates smaller
   than 0.21 mu m for at least 8 h. Thiol-containing organic acids such as
   cysteine and thioglycolate also decreased growth of HgS particles.
   Growth rates were also monitored as a function of monovalent electrolyte
   concentration, humic type, and humic concentration. HgS particles that
   formed in the presence of humics and thiolates were able to pass through
   conventional filters (<0.2 mu m) and appeared to consist of aggregates
   of nanocrystals in TEM images. Furthermore, 96% of HgS aggregates were
   removed from aqueous suspension when exposed to octanol, indicating that
   the particles could be incorrectly identified as dissolved complexes
   (e.g., HgS((aq))(0)) in bioavailability models. Hg speciation
   calculations were conducted to consider lower Hg concentrations observed
   in sediment porewater. While the calculations depended on Hg binding
   constants that can vary by orders of magnitude, the results indicated
   that HgS(,) could be oversaturated in filtered porewater, particularly
   at low dissolved sulfide levels (micromolar or lower). These insights
   suggest that nanoparticulate HgS can exist in surface waters and
   porewater of contaminated sediments as a result of kinetically hindered
   aggregation/precipitation reactions. Further studies are needed to
   address the importance of nanoscale HgS particles for governing the
   reactivity and bioavailability of mercury in the environment.

AB Phenanthrene sorption by nano-TiO2 and nano-ZnO particles was enhanced
   significantly by coated humic acids (HAS), implying that additional
   toxicity can be potentially given to these nano-oxides by adsorbed HOCs
   once released to the environment. Phenanthrene isotherms of adsorbed HA
   on nano-TiO2 and nano-ZnO were more nonlinear than that of their
   respective bulk HA. Both HA conformation changes and fractionation were
   observed upon HA adsorption on nano-TiO2 and nano-ZnO, which further
   affected phenanthrene sorption. Nano-TiO2 and nano-ZnO interacted with
   different functional groups of HA (i.e., phenolic OH with nano-TiO2,
   while COOH with nano-ZnO), leading to different conformations of
   adsorbed HA. Interaction of HA phenolic OH with nano-TiO2 increased the
   pi-polarity/polarizability of adsorbed HA and, consequently, its
   phenanthrene adsorption affinity and isotherm nonlinearity. Interactions
   of COOH groups on HA aromatic rings with nano-ZnO would also increase
   the pi-polarity/polarizability of adsorbed HA and its phenanthrene
   adsorption affinity, whereas interactions of COOH groups on HA aliphatic
   chains with nano-ZnO would make the adsorbed HA be in a more condensed
   state with lower partitioning affinity. Increase in adsorption and
   decrease in partitioning were responsible for the more nonlinear
   phenanthrene isotherms of adsorbed HA than bulk HA.

AB The increasing use of nanomaterials in consumer products has led to
   increased concerns about their potential environmental and health
   impacts. To better understand the transport, fate, and behavior of
   nanoparticles in aquatic systems, it is essential to understand their
   interactions with different components of natural waters including
   natural organic matter over a broad range of physicochemical conditions.
   Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy was used to determine the
   diffusion coefficients of TiO(2) nanoparticles having a nominal size of
   5 nm. The effects of a various concentrations of the Suwannee River
   Fulvic Acid (SRFA) and the roles of pH and ionic strength were
   evaluated. Aggregation of the bare TiO(2) nanoparticles increased for pH
   values near the zero point of charge. At any given pH, an increase in
   ionic strength generally resulted in increased aggregation. Furthermore,
   conditions which favored adsorption of the SRFA resulted in less
   aggregation of the TiO(2) nanoparticles, presumably due to increased
   steric repulsion. Under the conditions studied here, nanoparticle
   dispersions were often stable for environmentally relevant conditions of
   SRFA, pH, and ionic strength, suggesting that in the natural
   environment, TiO(2) dispersion might occur to a greater extent than
   expected.

AB The surface coating, aggregation behavior and aggregate structure of
   unpurified iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) at variable pH and in the
   absence and presence of natural organic matter (NOM, Suwannee River
   humic acid, SRHA) have been previously studied in Baalousha et al.
   [Baalousha, M., Manciulea, A., Cumberland, S., Kendall, K., Lead, J.R.,
   Aggregation and surface properties of iron oxide nanoparticles;
   influence of pH and natural organic matter. Environ Toxicol Chem 2008;
   27: 1875-1882.]. Here the aggregation behavior of iron oxide NPs at
   variable concentrations of NPs and SRHA, and the disaggregation behavior
   of iron oxide NP aggregates in the absence and presence of SRHA are
   investigated. The increase of NP concentration enhances their
   aggregation, particularly at pH values close to the point of zero charge
   (PZC). High concentration of SRHA (100 mg l(-1)) shifts the NP (100 mg
   l(-1)) PZC charge and aggregation maximum towards lower pHs, while low
   concentration (10 mg l(-1)) shows low or no effect. The disaggregation
   behavior of iron oxide NP aggregates was investigated at pH 7 and at
   increasing concentrations of SRHA. High concentrations (50 and 100 mg
   l(-1)) of SRHA induced the disaggregation of iron oxide NP aggregates
   with time, which was not the case at lower concentrations (10 mg l(-1))
   or in the absence of SRHA. The disaggregation was triggered by the
   enhanced surface charge induced by the sorption of SRHA molecules. The
   disaggregation rate increased with SRHA concentration and decreased with
   time. Two regimes of disaggregation were identified, a fast regime of
   "fragmentation" at the first 15 days of the experiment and a slow regime
   of "erosion" afterwards. The formation of small aggregates of about 170
   nm and surface coating of several nanometers of SRHA on iron oxide NPs
   confirm the role of NOM in the disaggregation process and indicate that
   NPs might mimic the behavior of natural colloids. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Imminent commercialization of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) has
   raised concerns regarding the potential environmental impact of these
   materials. Understanding the partitioning behavior and obtaining
   information on the mobility and persistence of QDs in water is key to
   evaluating potential ecological hazards posed by QDs in the environment.
   The role of natural organic matter (NOM) in the phase transfer of
   trioctylphosphine oxide-capped CdSe QDs from an organic solvent to water
   has been investigated. Results show that humic and fulvic acids, which
   have been used as model NOM, facilitate the stabilization of
   organic-capped QDs in water in less than 24 h. Spectroscopic studies
   indicate that some or all of the organic ligands of COS are conserved
   during the phase transfer. The displacement of organic ligands by NOM
   also appears to play a role in phase transfer. This NOM-mediated phase
   transfer has also been demonstrated using two natural surface water
   samples. This study presents the first evidence of the stabilization of
   QDs in water by humic substances in real environmental samples,
   illustrating that interactions with NOM will play a significant role in
   the fate and transport of QDs in natural aquatic systems.

AB Background: The dispersion-aggregation behaviors of suspended colloids
   in rivers and estuaries are affected by the compositions of suspended
   materials (i.e., clay minerals vs. organic macromolecules) and salinity.
   Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the dispersion and
   aggregation mechanisms of suspended particles under simulated river and
   estuarine conditions. The average hydrodynamic diameters of suspended
   particles (representing degree of aggregation) and zeta potential
   (representing the electrokinetic properties of suspended colloids and
   aggregates) were determined for systems containing suspended
   montmorillonite, humic acid, and/or chitin at the circumneutral pH over
   a range of salinity (0-7.2 psu).
   Results: The montmorillonite-only system increased the degree of
   aggregation with salinity increase, as would be expected for suspended
   colloids whose dispersion-aggregation behavior is largely controlled by
   the surface electrostatic properties and van der Waals forces. When
   montmorillonite is combined with humic acid or chitin, the aggregation
   of montmorillonite was effectively inhibited. The surface interaction
   energy model calculations reveal that the steric repulsion, rather than
   the increase in electronegativity, is the primary cause for the
   inhibition of aggregation by the addition of humic acid or chitin.
   Conclusion: These results help explain the range of
   dispersion-aggregation behaviors observed in natural river and estuarine
   systems. It is postulated that the composition of suspended particles,
   specifically the availability of steric polymers such as those contained
   in humic acid, determine whether the river suspension is rapidly
   aggregated and settled or remains dispersed in suspension when it
   encounters increasingly saline environments of estuaries and oceans.

   carboxyl-PEG-CdSe/ZnS core/shell quantum dots (QDs) in terms of number,

   humic acid or 50 mg C L -1 EPS did not significantly affect these
   parameters. In contrast, 5 or 50 mg C L -1 alginate at ionic strength of
   10 mM shifted the hydrodynamic radius toward larger values, suggesting a
   possible capture of QDs by the linear alginate chains. The addition of

   current study employs UV-visible absorbance and fluorescence
   spectroscopy to investigate the interactions of commercial humic acid
   (HA) with gold nanoparticles having a core size of 5 nm and coated with
   two different stabilizers, beta-D-glucose and citrate. Humic substances
   (HS) are fluorescent in nature, providing a unique probe of
   nanometer-scale morphological changes for interactions between these
   natural polyelectrolytes and water-soluble gold nanoparticles. Quenching
   of fluorescence intensity was observed with beta-D-glucose-coated gold
   nanoparticles, whereas an enhancement effect was noticed with the

   and 8 ppm (surface waters typically may contain ~10 ppm HS). Examining
   the quenching and enhancement of fluorescence provides insight into the
   structural changes taking place at the coated gold nanoparticle-HA
   interface. The quenching behavior suggested ligand exchange due to
   nanometer-scale contact between the HA and beta-D-glucose-coated gold
   nanoparticles, whereas the enhancement effect with citrate particles
   would indicate overcoating, leading to increased transfer distances for
   fluorescence resonance energy transfer.

AB In this work, data for the interactions between humic acid (HA) or
   fulvic acid (FA) with phosphate ions at the surface of goethite
   (alpha-FeOOH) are presented. The results show very clear differences
   between HA and FA in their interactions with phosphate at goethite
   surface. HA is strongly bound to goethite but surprisingly does not
   strongly affect the phosphate binding, whereas FA is less strongly
   bound, but these molecules have a very large effect on the phosphate
   adsorption, and vice versa. Phosphate adsorption to goethite in the
   presence of adsorbed HA or FA can be well predicted with the LCD model
   (ligand and charge distribution). According to the model calculations,
   the nature of the interactions between HA or FA with phosphate at
   goethite surface is mainly electrostatic. The stronger effects of FA on
   phosphate adsorption are caused by its spatial location which is closer
   to the oxide surface, and as a consequence, the electrostatic
   interactions between adsorbed FA particles and phosphate ions are much
   stronger than for HA particles. This is the first time that effects of
   natural organic matter (NOM) on an anion adsorption are predicted
   successfully using an integrated ion-binding model for oxides and for
   humics that accounts for chemical heterogeneity of NOM.

AB The colloidal behavior of aluminum oxide nanoparticles (NPs) was
   investigated as a function of pH and in the presence of two structurally
   different humic acids (HAs), Aldrich HA (AHA) and the seventh HA
   fraction extracted from Amherst peat soil (HA7). Dynamic light
   scattering (DLS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were employed to
   determine the colloidal behavior of the NPs. Influence of pH and HAs on
   the surface charges of the NPs was determined. zeta-Potential data
   clearly showed that the surface charge of the NPs decreased with
   increasing pH and reached the point of zero charge (ZPC) at pH 7.9.
   Surface charge of the NPs also decreased with the addition of HAs. The
   NPs tend to aggregate as the pH of the suspension approaches ZPC, where
   van der Waals attraction forces dominate over electrostatic repulsion.
   However, the NP colloidal suspension was stable in the pHs far from ZPC.
   Colloidal stability was strongly enhanced in the presence of HAs at the
   pH of ZPC or above it, but in acidic conditions NPs showed strong
   aggregation in the presence of HAs. AFM imaging revealed the presence of
   long-chain fractions in HA7, which entangled with the NPs to form large
   aggregates. The association of HA with the NP surface can be assumed to
   follow a two-step process, possibly the polar fractions of the HA7
   sorbed on the NP surface followed by entanglement with the long-chain
   fractions. Thus, our study demonstrated that the hydrophobic nature of
   the HA molecules strongly influenced the aggregation of colloidal NPs,
   possibly through their conformational behavior in a particular solution
   condition. Therefore, various organic matter samples will result in
   different colloidal behavior of NPs, subsequently their environmental
   fate and transport.

AB In sulfidic aquatic systems, metal sulfides can control the mobility and
   bioavailability of trace metal pollutants such as zinc, mercury, and
   silver. Nanoparticles of ZnS and other metal sulfides are known to exist
   in oxic and anoxic waters. However, the processes that lead to their
   persistence in the aquatic environment are relatively unknown. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the importance of dissolved
   natural organics in stabilizing nanoparticulate ZnS that precipitates
   under environmentally relevant conditions. Precipitation and growth of
   ZnS particles were investigated in the presence of dissolved humic acid
   and low-molecular weight organic acids that are prevalent in sediment
   porewater. Dynamic light scattering was used to monitor the hydrodynamic
   diameter of particles precipitating in laboratory solutions. Zn
   speciation was also measured by filtering the ZnS solutions (< 0.2 mu m)
   and using anodic stripping voltammetry to confirm that Zn was
   coordinated to sulfide during the precipitation experiments and not to
   the dissolved organic ligands. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and
   electron microscopy were used to confirm that amorphous particles
   containing Zn and S were precipitating in the suspensions. Observed
   growth rates of ZnS particles varied by orders of magnitude, depending
   on the type and concentration of organic ligand in solution. In the
   presence of humic acid and thiol-containing ligands (cysteine,
   glutathione, and thioglycolate), observed growth rates decreased by 1-3
   orders of magnitude relative to controls without the ligands. In
   contrast, growth rates of the particles were consistently within I order
   of magnitude of the ligand-free control when oxygen- and
   amine-containing ligands (oxalate, serine, and glycolate) were present.
   Furthermore, particle growth rates decreased with an increase in thiol
   concentration and increased with NaNO(3) electrolyte concentration.
   These studies suggest that specific surface interactions with
   thiol-containing organics may be one factor that contributes to the
   persistence of naturally occurring and anthropogenic nanoparticles of
   ZnS and other metal sulfides in the aquatic environment.

AB Sorption of pyrene by regular and nanoscaled aluminum, zinc, and
   titanium oxides was examined. All oxides had low sorption for pyrene
   because of sorbed water molecules. Due to the larger surface area (SA)
   of nanoparticles, they had higher sorption for pyrene than the regular
   ones. Organic matter (0 M) coating greatly enhanced pyrene sorption by
   all oxides, noting the importance of sorbed OM in sorption of
   hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs). Due to higher sorption site
   density in the sorbed OM phase on the regular oxide surfaces,
   SA-normalized distribution coefficients (K(dSA)) of pyrene by OM-regular
   oxide complexes (6.0-40.6) were greater than the OM-coated oxide
   nanoparticles (0.7-12.5). Furthermore,the OM-regular oxide complexes had
   higher organic carbon content-normalized KdSA values of pyrene (48-17
   300) than the OM-nanoscaled oxide complexes (15-1530). This variation
   may be due to different physical forms and fractionation of the loaded
   OM on regular and nanoscaled oxide particles.

   for the removal of toxic Hg(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), and Cu(II) from water.
   Fe3O4/HA were prepared by a coprecipitation procedure with cheap and
   environmentally friendly iron salts and HA. TOC and XPS analysis showed
   the as-prepared Fe3O4/ HA contains similar to 11% (w/w) of HA which are
   fractions abundant in O and N-based functional groups. TEM images and
   laser particle size analysis revealed the Fe3O4/HA (with similar to 10
   nm Fe3O4 cores) aggregated in aqueous suspensions to form aggregates
   with an average hydrodynamic size of similar to 140 nm. With a
   saturation magnetization of 79.6 emu/g, the Fe3O4/HA can be simply
   recovered from water with magnetic separations at low magnetic field
   gradients within a few minutes. Sorption of the heavy metals to Fe3O4/HA
   reached equilibrium in less than 15 min, and agreed well to the Langmuir
   adsorption model with maximum adsorption capacities from 46.3 to 97.7
   mg/g. The Fe3O4/HA was stable in tap water, natural waters, and acidic/
   basic solutions ranging from 0.1 M HCl to 2 M NaOH with low leaching of
   Fe (<= 3.7%) and HA (<= 5.3%). The Fe3O4/HA was able to remove over 99%
   of Hg(II) and Pb(II) and over 95% of COO and Cd(II) in natural and tap
   water at optimized pH. Leaching back of the Fe3O4/HA sorbed heavy metals
   in water was found to be negligible.

AB The interactions between unpurified manufactured nanoparticles (NPs;
   iron oxide NPs, similar to 7 nm) and standard Suwannee River humic acid
   (SRHA) were investigated under a range of environmentally relevant
   conditions. At low pH, approximately 35% of the total iron was in the
   dissolved phase (< 1 kDa), present from the initial synthesis, whereas
   at pH more than 4, this concentration was negligible because of the
   formation of new particles via hydrolysis. Dynamic light scattering
   results indicated that extensive aggregation of NPs began at
   approximately pH 5 to 6 and reached a maximum at approximately pH 8.5,
   whereas with added SRHA, aggregation was shifted to lower pH values of 4
   to 5 and was affected by SRHA concentration. Aggregation could be
   explained mainly by charge neutralization. Further, more detailed
   investigations by flow field-flow fractionation and
   transmission-electron microscopy were performed under a more restricted
   set of conditions (pH 2 - 6) to examine the aggregation process. Results
   indicated the formation of SRHA surface coating on iron oxide NPs of
   approximately 1 nm and the increase in thickness of this coating with
   the increase of SRHA concentration. Iron oxide NPs were shown to form
   increasingly large aggregates with increases in both pH (from 2 to 6)
   and SRHA concentration (from 0 to 25 mg/L). The structure and
   aggregation mechanism of these aggregates were found to be both pH and
   SRHA concentration dependent, with open, porous aggregates in the
   absence of SRHA and compact aggregates in the presence of SRHA.

AB The increasing exploitation of nanomaterials into many consumer and
   other products is raising concerns as these nanomaterials are likely to
   be released into the environment. Due to our lack of knowledge about the
   environmental chemistry, transport and ecotoxicology of nanomaterials,
   it is of paramount importance to study how natural aquatic colloids can
   interact with manufactured gold nanoparticles as these interactions will
   determine their environmental fate and behaviour. In this context, our
   work aims to quantify the effect of naturally occurring riverine
   macromolecules - International Humic Substances Society (IHSS) Suwannee
   River Humic Acid Standard (SRHA) - on citrate- and acrylate-stabilized
   gold nanoparticles. The influence of SRHA on the stability of the gold
   colloids was studied as a function of pH by UV-visible absorption
   spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). At high ionic strengths (0.1 M), extensive and rapid
   aggregation occurred, while more subtle effects were observed at lower
   ionic strength values. Evidence was found that SRHA enhances particle
   stability at extreme pH values (ionic strength < 0.01 M) by substituting
   and/or over-coating the original stabilizer on the gold nanoparticle
   surface, thus affecting surface charge and chemistry. These findings
   have important implications for the fate and behaviour of nanoparticles
   in the environment and their ecotoxicity. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Injection of nanoscale zero-valent iron (NZVI) is potentially a
   promising technology for remediation of contaminated groundwaters.
   However, the efficiency of this process is significantly hindered by the
   rapid aggregation of the iron nanoparticles. The aim of this study was
   to enhance the colloidal stability of the nanoparticles through the
   addition of the "green" polymer guar gum. We evaluated the properties of
   guar gum and its influence on the surface properties, particle size,
   aggregation, and sedimentation of iron nanoparticles. Commercial iron
   nanoparticles were dispersed in guar gum solutions, and their
   aggregation and sedimentation behaviors were compared to those of bare
   iron nanoparticles and commercial nanoparticles modified with a
   biodegradable polymer (polyaspartate). High performance size exclusion
   chromatography, charge titration, and viscosity assessment showed that
   guar gum is a high molecular weight polymer which is nearly neutrally
   charged, rendering it suitable for steric stabilization of the iron
   nanoparticles. Electrophoretic mobility measurements demonstrated the
   ability of guar gum to adsorb on the nanoparticles, forming a slightly
   negatively charged layer. Dynamic light scattering experiments were
   conducted to estimate the particle size of the different nanoparticle
   suspensions and to determine the aggregation behavior at different ionic
   strengths. Guar gum effectively reduced the hydrodynamic radius of the
   bare nanoparticles from 500 nm to less than 200 nm and prevented
   aggregation of the nanoparticles even at very high salt concentrations
   (0.5 M NaCl and 3 MM CaCl(2)). Sedimentation profiles of the different
   nanoparticle suspensions confirmed the improved stability of the iron
   nanoparticles in the presence of guar gum. The results strongly suggest
   that guar gum can be used to effectively deliver stabilized zero-valent
   iron nanoparticles for remediation of contaminated groundwater aquifers.

AB In this study, the adsorption of two organic acids, oxalic acid and
   adipic acid, on TiO2 nanoparticles was investigated at room temperature,
   298 K. Solution-phase measurements were used to quantify the extent and
   reversibility of oxalic acid and adipic acid adsorption on anatase
   nanoparticles with primary particle sizes of 5 and 32 nm. At all pH
   values considered, there were minimal differences in measured Langmuir
   adsorption constants, K-ads, or surface-area-normalized maximum
   adsorbate-surface coverages, Gamma(max), between 5 and 32 nm particles.
   Although macroscopic differences in the reactivity of these organic
   acids as a function of nanoparticle size were not observed, ATR-FIFIR
   spectroscopy showed some distinct differences in the absorption bands
   present for oxalic acid adsorbed on 5 nm particles compared to 32 mn
   particles, suggesting different adsorption sites or a different
   distribution of adsorption sites for oxalic acid on the 5 nm particles.
   These results illustrate that molecular-level differences in
   nanoparticle reactivity can still exist even when macroscopic
   differences are not observed from solution phase measurements. Our
   results also allowed the impact of nanoparticle aggregation on acid
   uptake to be assessed. It is clear that particle aggregation occurs at
   all pH values and that organic acids can destabilize nanoparticle
   suspensions. Furthermore, 5 nm particles can form larger aggregates
   compared to 32 nm particles under the same conditions of pH and solid
   concentrations. The relative reactivity of 5 and 32 mn particles as
   determined from Langmuir adsorption parameters did not appear to vary
   greatly despite differences that occur in nanoparticle aggregation for
   these two different size nanoparticles. Although this potentially
   suggests that aggregation does not impact organic acid uptake on anatase
   particles, these data clearly show that challenges remain in assessing
   the available surface area for adsorption in nanoparticle aqueous
   suspensions because of aggregation.

AB In the interest of fully assessing the potential environmental risks
   linked to "nanolitter," we need to be able to predict the persistence,
   toxicity, and mobility of engineered nanomaterials. in the natural
   subsurface environment. To examine the effects of particle size and
   natural organic matter on nanoparticle mobility, laboratory-scale
   filtration experiments were performed using different sized model
   nanomaterials (i.e., latex colloids having diameters of 50, 110, and
   1500 nm) in the presence and absence of 5.0 mg/L Suwannee River humic
   acid (SRHA). At low ionic strengths (1-10 mM KCI), an increase in
   attachment efficiency (alpha) with increasing particle size was
   observed. This result contrasts with predictions of particle filtration
   based on attachment in the primary energy minimum of the particle-grain
   interaction energy profile evaluated using
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. The presence of SRHA
   generally resulted in a decrease in alpha over the range of experimental
   conditions investigated. Results of particle transport experiments
   combined with particle characterization measurements suggest that the
   decrease in colloid attachment in the presence of SRHA is related to the
   combined influence of the mechanisms of charge stabilization and steric
   stabilization. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) particles are 5-40 nm sized
   Fe(0)/Fe-oxide particles that rapidly transform many environmental
   contaminants to benign products and are a promising in situ remediation
   agent. Rapid aggregation and limited mobility in water-saturated porous
   media limits the ability to deliver NZVI dispersions in the subsurface.
   This study prepares stable NZVI dispersions through physisorption of
   commercially available anionic polyelectrolytes, characterizes the
   adsorbed polymer layer, and correlates the polymer coating properties
   with the ability to prevent rapid aggregation and sedimentation of NZVI
   dispersions. Poly(styrene sulfonate) with molecular weights of 70 k and
   1,000 k g/mol (PSS70K and PSS1M), carboxymethyl cellulose with molecular
   weights of 90 k and 700 k g/mol (CMC90K and CMC700K), and polyaspartate
   with molecular weights of 2.5 k and 10 k g/mol (PAP2.5K and 10K) were
   compared. Particle size distributions were determined by dynamic light
   scattering during aggregation. The order of effectiveness to prevent
   rapid aggregation and stabilize the dispersions was PSS70K(83%) >
   approximate to PAP10K(82%) > PAP2.5K(72%) > CMC700K(52%), where
   stability is defined operationally as the volume percent of particles
   that do not aggregate after 1 h. CMC90K and PSS1M could not stabilize
   RNIP relative to bare RNIP. A similar trend was observed for their
   ability to prevent sedimentation, with 40, 34, 32, 20, and 5 wt%, of the
   PSS70K, PAP10K, PAP2.5K, CMC700K, and CMC90K modified NZVI remaining
   suspended after 7 h of quiescent settling, respectively. The stable
   fractions with respect to both aggregation and sedimentation correlate
   well with the adsorbed polyelectrolyte mass and thickness of the
   adsorbed polyelectrolyte layers as determined by Oshima's soft particle
   theory. A fraction of the particles cannot be stabilized by any modifier
   and rapidly agglomerates to micron sized aggregates, as is also observed
   for unmodified NZVI. This non-dispersible fraction is attributed to
   strong magnetic attractions among the larger particles present in the
   polydisperse NZVI slurry, as the magnetic attractive forces increase as
   r(6).

   of the aggregates provided evidence that alginate gel formation was
   essential for enhanced aggregation to occur. Dynamic light scattering
   (DLS) aggregation results clearly indicated that a much lower
   concentration of Ba2+ compared to Ca2+ and Sr2+ was required to achieve
   a similar degree of enhanced aggregation in each system. To elucidate
   the relationship between the alginate's affinities for divalent cations
   and the enhanced aggregation of the alginate-coated hematite
   nanoparticles, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to probe the
   interaction forces between alginate-coated hematite surfaces under the
   solution chemistries used for the aggregation study. Maximum adhesion
   forces, maximum pull-off distances, and the work of adhesion were used
   as indicators to gauge the alginate's affinity for the divalent cations
   and the resulting attractive interactions between alginate-coated
   hematite nanoparticles. The results showed that alginate had higher
   affinity for Ba2+ than either Sr2+ or Ca2+. This same trend was
   consistent with the cation concentrations required for comparable
   enhanced aggregation kinetics, suggesting that the rate of alginate gel
   formation controls the enhanced aggregation kinetics. An aggregation
   mechanism incorporating the gelation of alginate is proposed to explain
   the accelerated aggregate growth in the presence of Ca2+, Sr2+, and
   Ba2+.

AB Batch experiments were performed to investigate the feasibility of humic
   acid (HA) removal by synthetic nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) and its
   interaction with As(III) and As(V), the most poisonous and abundant of
   groundwater pollutants. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy
   (HR-TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the
   particle size, surface morphology of the pristine NZVI and HA-treated
   NZVI (NZVI-HA), and the zero valence state of the pristine NZVI. It was
   determined that HA was completely removed by NZVI (0.3 g/L) within a few
   minutes, at a wide range of initial pH values (similar to 3.0-12.0).
   Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and laser light scattering (zeta
   potential measurement) studies confirmed that NZVI-HA forms inner-sphere
   surface complexation at different initial pH conditions. The effects of
   competing anions showed that there was complete removal of HA in the
   presence of 10 mM NO3- and SO42- whereas HA removal was observed 0%, 18%
   and 22% in presence of 10 mM H2PO42-, HCO3- and H4SiO40, respectively.
   However, the presence of 2 mM Ca2+ and Mg2+ enhanced HA removal from 17
   mg g(-1) to 76 mg g(-1) and 55 mg g(-1), respectively. Long-term
   time-resolved studies of XRD and field emission scanning electron
   microscopy (FE-SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) revealed the
   formation of various types of new iron oxides (magnetite, maghemite, and
   lepidocrocites) during the continuous reaction of HA in the presence of
   water and NZVI at 1, 30, 60, and 90 days. In addition, the
   surface-area-normalized rate constant (k(sa)) of adsorption of As(III)
   and As(V) onto NZVI was reduced in the presence of HA (20 mg L-1), from
   100% to 43% and 68%, respectively. Our results show the potential use of
   NZVI in removing HA and its possible effects on arsenic removal during
   the application of NZVI in groundwater remediation.

AB The organic matter content and ionic composition of soil solutions have
   a dominant effect on soil structure, forming gradually an aggregation of
   mineral particles, in which clay fractions play a determining role. The
   colloidal interaction of particles, including repulsion and attraction,
   changes with their inherent surface properties and the interfacial layer
   composition around them, resulting in chemical and physical equilibria
   between solid and aqueous phases. These interactions and their
   relationship were studied in model systems containing soil constituents
   having a definite role in the formation of soil structure and are
   organized into two parts, here the interfacial processes as part 1, with
   the particle network formation in the second part. The adsorption of
   humic acid (HA) on montmorillonite was studied under conditions relevant
   to the environment at pH similar to 6.5 and 0.0014 M NaCl. The effect of
   Ca loading from 0.0013 to 0.0055 M was the focus of the work. Both HA
   and Ca(2+) adsorption were measured. To reveal molecular insight into
   the interactions between HA, Ca(2+) and montmorillonite, the HA
   concentration was related to the molar amount of its acidic functional
   groups. Adsorptive fractionation of HA was characterized using
   spectrophotometric parameters (SUVA(254), E(3)/E(4) and E(4)/E(6)). The
   fourfold increase in Ca loading resulted in more than ten times greater
   HA adsorption, but only three times greater Ca(2+) adsorption, during
   which the distribution between the solid and liquid phases changed
   considerably. The dominant processes were preferential Na(+)/Ca(2+) ion
   exchange and complexation by HA both in the aqueous phase and on
   montmorillonite (through Ca bridges on the faces and directly on Al-OH
   sites at the edges), causing adsorptive fractionation of organic matter
   and leaving the small, less humified HA fraction in the aqueous phase.

AB Charge state and particle network formation were studied at pH 6-6.5 in
   model systems containing montmorillonite, humic acid (HA) and calcium
   ions (Ca2+), which are responsible for microaggregate formation in
   soils. Since dispersing and aggregation of particles are governed by the
   composition of the coating layer on particle surfaces, the interfacial
   equilibria for the same systems were studied in Part I. Here, the
   composition of the systems was based on the HA and Ca2+ adsorption
   results using a meaningful HA concentration unit related to the molar
   amount of its acidic functional groups. Approaching real conditions, the
   effect of Ca loading was also studied at low and high HA content,
   representing the colloid fractions of soil poor (similar to 0.5%) and
   rich (similar to 5%) in organic matter. The zeta potential was measured
   and the structure of dense suspensions was characterized using rheology.
   HA addition breaks down the shear-tolerant structure of the particle
   network forming in montmorillonite suspensions at pH similar to 6.5.
   Suspensions become liquefied due to the dispersing effect of the HA.
   However, a much stronger structure can build up, if both HA and Ca2+ are
   present in optimal ratio, which can be readily estimated from the charge
   balance between negative charges (cation exchange sites on
   montmorillonite and acidic groups of HA) and positive charges of Ca2+.
   On the other hand, zeta potential determination did not support these
   changes, except the dispersing effect of HA. The strengthening of the
   particle network was quantified using the Bingham yield values. With
   increasing Ca loading, an almost fivefold increase in shear tolerance
   could be attained in HA-rich suspensions vs. those without HA or with
   low HA content. The aggregation of mineral particles is enhanced by the
   joint effect of HA and Ca2+. The higher the OM content, the more the Ca
   loading is expected to reach optimal aggregation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effects of orthophosphate on the adsorption of natural organic
   matter (NOM) on aluminum hydroxide were investigated using three organic
   compounds as surrogates, including humic acid (HA), phthalic acid, and
   2,3-clihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DIABA). The adsorption of phthalic acid
   and 2,3-DHBA was very limited compared to that of HA, whereas their
   adsorption was reduced Much more significantly than that of HA by
   phosphate. The efficiency of phosphate in reducing HA adsorption
   increased with increasing phosphate concentration. Phosphate adsorption
   was slightly reduced by plithalic acid and 2,3-DHBA but moderately
   Suppressed by HA. The adjacent carboxylic groups mainly contributed to
   the adsorption Of humic acid at low pH. while the adjacent phenol groups
   were responsible for the adsorption Of humic acid at high pH. HPLC-SEC
   and SUVA analysis revealed that HA molecules with high Molecular Weight
   were adsorbed preferentially but were easily displaced by the
   specifically adsorbed phosphate. TM-AFM images revealed that the
   aggregation of HA molecules and the protonation of carboxylic groups at
   41 low pH facilitated the adsorption under acidic conditions. The
   presence of phosphate increases the coagulant dosage for NOM removal as
   some sites oil the coagulant precipitates become utilized by phosphate.

AB The early stage aggregation kinetics of bare and alginate-coated
   hematite nanoparticles are acquired through time-resolved dynamic light
   scattering (DILS). Varying concentrations of monovalent (NaCl) and
   divalent (MgCl2 and CaCl2) electrolytes are employed to induce
   aggregation. In the presence of NaCl and MgCl2,the alginate-coated
   hematite nanoparticles undergo aggregation through electrostatic
   destabilization as described by the classic
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. This is ascertained
   through examination of the favorable and unfavorable regimes of the
   stability curves depicting the attachment efficiency as a function of
   salt concentration. Additional evidence may be found in the aggregation
   kinetics of alginate-coated particles, which under favorable aggregation
   conditions, are reasonably close to that of bare hematite nanoparticles.
   However, in the presence of CaCl2,the aggregate growth rate of
   alginate-coated hematite nanoparticles is much higher than that which
   conventional diffusive aggregation predicts. Dispersed hematite primary
   particles and lower-order aggregates enmeshed within extended alginate
   gel networks were observed under transmission electron microscope (TEM).
   The proposed mechanism for enhanced aggregation suggests an apparent
   increase in the collision radii of alginate coated hematite
   nanoparticles through alginate gel network formation from the particle
   surface. Additionally, cross-linking between unadsorbed (suspended)
   alginate macromolecules may form bridges between hematite-alginate gel
   clusters. It is further established that the presence of background
   electrolyte NaCl in solution is detrimental to the calcium-induced
   enhanced aggregation.

   effect on the surface charging and the aggregation of oxide particles
   were investigated. HA was extracted from brown coal. Synthetic magnetite
   was prepared by alkaline hydrolysis of iron(II) and iron(III) salts. The
   pH-dependent particle charge and aggregation, and coagulation kinetics
   at pH similar to 4 were measured by laser Doppler electrophoresis and
   dynamic light scattering. The charge of pure magnetite reverses from
   positive to negative at pH similar to 8, which may consider as
   isoelectric point (IEP). Near this pH, large aggregates form, while
   stable sols exist further from it. In the presence of increasing HA
   loading, the IEP shifts to lower pH, then at higher loading, magnetite
   becomes negatively charged even at low pHs, which indicate the
   neutralization and gradual recharging positive charges on surface. In
   acidic region, the trace HA amounts are adsorbed on magnetite surface as
   oppositely charged patches, systems become highly unstable due to
   heterocoagulation. Above the adsorption saturation, however, the
   nanoparticles are stabilized in a way of combined steric and
   electrostatic effects. The HA coated magnetite particles form stable
   colloidal dispersion, particle aggregation does not occur in a wide
   range of pH and salt tolerance is enhanced. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

AB The molecular mechanism of montmorillonite flocculation by bacterial
   polysaccharides was investigated, with special emphasis on the effect of
   carboxylic charges in the macromolecules on the mechanisms of
   interaction with the clay surface. An indirect way to quantify the
   energy of interaction was used, by comparing the flocculation ability of
   variously acidic poly saccharides. Data on tensile strength of
   aggregates in diluted suspension were collected by timed size
   measurements in the domain 0.1-600 mu m, using laser diffraction. The
   flow behavior of settled aggregates was studied by theology
   measurements. Flocculation of colloidal clay suspension by
   polysaccharides requires canceling of the electrostatic repulsions by
   salts, which allows approach of clay surfaces close enough to be bridged
   by adsorbing macromolecules. The amount of acidic charges of the
   polysaccharides, and especially their location in the molecular
   structure, governs the bridging mechanism and the resulting tensile
   strength of the aggregates. The exposure of carboxylate groups located
   on side chains strongly promotes flocculation. In turn, charges located
   on the backbone of the polysaccharide are less accessible to
   interaction, and the flocculation ability of such polysaccharides is
   lowered. Measurements at different pH indicate that adsorption of acidic
   polysaccharides occurs via electrostatic interactions on the amphoteric
   edge surface of clay platelets, whereas neutral polysaccharides rather

AB Batch sorption experiments with peat humic acid (PHA) were carried out
   with two types of clay minerals (kaolinite and montmorillonite) under
   various solution conditions to determine the influence of solution
   chemistry (e.g. ionic strength, pH and solution cation) and mineralogy
   on PHA sorption to mineral surfaces. Consistent with contemporary
   studies, PHA sorption increased with increasing ionic strength and
   decreasing pH, and the presence of the background electrolyte Ca2+
   largely enhanced sorption in comparison to Na+. An attempt was made to
   separate the contributions of various modes of interactions to PHA
   sorption in our experiments, where ligand exchange was estimated to
   account for approximately 32% of PHA sorption on clay surfaces, van der
   Waals 22% and cation bridging 41% when Ca2+ was the background
   electrolyte. Kaolinite displayed higher adsorption for PHA than
   montmorillonite under the same solution conditions, which is explained
   by selective sorption of PHA by different clays and different binding
   mechanisms. H-1 High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning (HR-MAS) NMR was
   employed to examine the chemical nature of mineral-bound PHA. By
   employing 1H NMR techniques, direct evidence for the selective sorption
   of CH, groups and proteins on clay mineral surfaces was obtained.
   Montmorillonite displayed a higher uptake of aromatics and proteins
   while more CH2 groups were observed to sorb to kaolinite surfaces. (c)

AB We investigated the adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) on
   colloidal Al2O3 particles in an aqueous environment. Changes in the zeta
   potential of the Al2O3 particles upon the adsorption of BSA were
   measured using an electro-acoustic technique. The mass of protein
   adsorbed was determined by using UV-vis spectroscopy. The change of the
   isoelectric point of the Al2O3 powder-protein suspension was found to be
   a function of adsorbed protein mass. It was shown that approximately one
   monolayer of BSA was needed to fully mask the surface and to compromise
   the charge of Al2O3. From titration experiments it follows that about
   30-36% of the negatively charged groups of the protein form bonds with
   the protonated and charged Al2O3 surface. On the basis of our
   observations we introduced a new adsorption model for BSA on Al2O3
   particles.

AB The stability and aggregation behavior of iron oxide colloids in natural
   waters play an important role in controlling the fate, transport, and
   bioavailability of trace metals. Time-resolved dynamic light scattering
   experiments were carried out in a study of the aggregation kinetics and
   aggregate structure of natural organic matter (NOM) coated hematite
   colloids and bare hematite colloids. The aggregation behavior was
   examined over a range of solution chemistries, by adjusting the
   concentration of the supporting electrolyte-NaCl, CaCl2, or simulated
   seawater. With the solution pH adjusted so that NOM-coated and bare
   hematite colloids were at the same zeta potential, we observed a
   significant difference in colloid stability which results from the
   stability imparted to the colloids by the adsorbed NOM macromolecules.
   This enhanced stability of NOM-coated hematite colloids was not observed
   with CaCl2. Aggregate form expressed as fractal dimension was determined
   for both NOM-coated and bare hematite aggregates in both NaCl and CaCl2.
   The fractal dimensions of aggregates formed in the diffusion-limited
   regime indicate slightly more loosely packed aggregates for bare
   hematite than theory predicts. For NOM-coated hematite, a small decrease
   in fractal dimension was observed when the solution composition changed
   from NaCl to CaCl2. For systems in the reaction-limited regime, the
   measured fractal dimensions agreed with those in the literature. Colloid
   aggregation was also studied in synthetic seawater, a mixed cation
   system to simulate estuarine mixing. Those results describe the
   important phenomena of iron oxide aggregation and sedimentation in
   estuaries. When compared to field data from the Mullica Estuary, U.S.A.,
   it is shown that collision efficiency is a good predictor of the iron
   removal in this natural system.

AB Aggregation and dispersion of mineral particles spontaneously take place
   under changing environmental conditions in natural systems. The
   structure of particle network in soils, the retardation or release of
   colloidal particles, and their mobility and transport are inherently
   influenced by natural organic matter bound to the mineral matrix. Since
   the surface properties of clay mineral and metal oxide particles, and
   the electrified mineral-water interfaces play a major role in formation,
   structure and strength of aggregates, any surface modification,
   especially by polyanionic organic complexants such as humic substances,
   has a significant affect on particle interaction in a mineral
   assemblage. The permanently and/or conditionally charged clay minerals
   (montmorillonite and kaolinite) and iron oxides (hematite and
   magnetite), as known major mineral components in natural waters, were
   selected for studying their surface charge characteristics and pH
   dependent interactions. We discuss how the surface charge correlates
   with particle aggregation through some characteristic examples for homo
   and heterocoagulation of similar and dissimilar mineral particles under
   acidic condition (at pH similar to4) in the dilute and concentrated
   systems studied by means of light scattering and theology, respectively.
   The adsorption of a brown coal derived humic acid, and its influence on
   the surface charge character and particle aggregation of clay and iron
   oxide particles were also studied in dilute and concentrated
   suspensions. Humic acids can be bound to the most reactive surface sites
   of clay and oxide particles, i.e. to Al-OH mainly at the edges of clay
   lamellae, and to Fe-OH on iron oxides, in surface complexation reaction,
   therefore their role in particle aggregation is specific. Relations
   between surface complexation, surface charge modification, and particle
   aggregation in pure and mixed montmorillonite-iron oxide systems are
   explained. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ionic strength dependence of humic acid (HA) adsorption on magnetite
   (Fe3O4) was investigated at pH similar to5, similar to8 and similar to9,
   where variable charged magnetite is positive, neutral and negative,
   respectively. The adsorption studies revealed that HA has high affinity
   to magnetite surface especially at lower pH, where interacting partners
   have opposite charges. However, in spite of electrostatic repulsion at
   pH similar to9 notable amounts of humate are adsorbed. Increasing ionic
   strength enhances HA adsorption at each pH due to charge screening. The
   dominant interaction is probably a ligand-exchange reaction,
   nevertheless the Coulombic contribution to the organic matter
   accumulation on oxide surface is also significant under acidic
   condition. The results from size exclusion chromatography demonstrate
   that the smaller size HA fractions enriched with functional groups are
   adsorbed preferentially on the surface of magnetite at pH similar to8 in
   dilute NaCl solution. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work deals with the effect of humic acid (HA) adsorption on the
   interfacial properties, the stability, and the rheology of aqueous iron
   oxide (hematite) suspensions. It is first of all demonstrated that HA
   effectively adsorbs onto hematite, mainly at acid pH. Since the charge
   of the HA chains is negative, it will be electrostatically attracted to
   the hematite surface below the point of zero charge of the particles,
   when they are positively charged. Electrophoresis measurements of
   hematite suspensions as a function of pH in the presence and absence of
   HA clearly demonstrate the adsorption of negatively charged entities on
   the oxide. Since the HA-covered particles can be thought of as "soft"
   colloids, Ohshima's theory was used to gain information on the surface
   potential and the charge density of the HA layer (H. Ohshima, in: A.V.
   Delgado (Ed.), Interfacial Electrokinetics and Electrophoresis, Dekker,
   New York, 2002, p. 123). A different procedure was also used to
   ascertain the degree of modification experienced by the hematite surface
   when placed in contact with HA solutions. The contact angles of selected
   liquids on pretreated hematite layers lead to the conclusion that the
   humic acid molecules impart to the particles a significant
   electron-donor character, in turn increasing their hydrophilicity. All
   this amount of information is used in the work for the interpretation of
   the rheological properties of hematite suspensions; the results are
   consistent with a stabilizing effect of HA adsorption on the
   suspensions, mainly as a consequence of the increased electrostatic
   repulsion between particles. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We studied the flocculation kinetics and structure of hematite
   aggregates induced by a large rigid extracellular polysaccharide,
   schizophyllan. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force
   microscopy (AFM), photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), and static
   light scattering (SLS) were used to characterize hematite particles,
   schizophyllan chains, and their flocs, to follow the time evolution of
   floc sizes, and to determine floc fractal dimensions. A maximum
   flocculation rate was found at a certain schizophyllan/hematite ratio.
   The maximum rate was considerably smaller than the rate of
   diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) of hematite particles induced by
   simple electrolytes. To interpret the experimental results and to reveal
   various factors affecting the optimal dosage, Monte Carlo simulations
   were performed on the flocculation of small colloidal particles by
   relatively long, monodisperse linear polymers. The existence of the
   maximum flocculation rate was confirmed by computer simulation. However,
   a higher optimal dosage of schizophyllan was obtained in the
   experiments. The difference in the optimal dosage can be attributed
   mostly to the higher adsorption affinity of the hematite on
   schizophyllan aggregates present in the initial solution and the
   presence of a large fraction of free polymer chains which do not
   participate in the flocculation process. Both experiments and computer
   simulations demonstrated the fractal nature of the
   schizophyllan-hematite flocs. The fractal dimensions of the flocs at the
   optimal dosage were determined. A higher fractal dimension was obtained
   from experiments than from computer simulations, suggesting a
   reconstruction of the floc structure. Finally, a two-stage flocculation
   mechanism for hematite particles in the presence of a relatively long
   schizophyllan polymer was proposed. In the first flocculation stage, the
   hematite particles are preferentially adsorbed onto the schizophyllan
   aggregates in solution. The second stage consists of the association of
   these reactive entities with each other and also with naked chains to
   form fractal flocs by a bridging mechanism, where the hematite particles
   play the role of ligands. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Molecular weight (MW) fractionation of Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA)
   and purified Aldrich humic acid (PAHA) by adsorption onto kaolinite and
   hematite was investigated in equilibrium and rate experiments with a
   size-exclusion chromatography system using ultraviolet (UV) light
   detection. The extent of adsorptive fractionation based on UV detection
   was positively correlated with the percent carbon adsorption for both
   humic substances (HS), although the specific fractionation pattern
   observed depended on the particular HS and mineral used. Higher MW
   fractions of SRFA, an aquatic HS, were preferentially adsorbed to both
   kaolinite and hematite whereas the fractionation trends for PAHA, a
   terrestrial peat HS, differed for the two minerals. The contrasting
   fractionation patterns for SRFA versus PAHA can be explained reasonably
   well by the different structural trends that occur in their respective
   MW fractions and the underlying adsorption processes. Rate studies of
   adsorptive fractionation revealed an initial rapid uptake of smaller HS
   molecules by the mineral surfaces, followed by their replacement at the
   surface by a much slower uptake of the larger HS molecules present in
   aqueous solution. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Under natural conditions, the adsorption of ions at the solid-water

   matter. In this paper, we describe the adsorption of fulvic acid (FA) by
   metal (hydr)oxide surfaces with a heterogeneous surface complexation
   model, the ligand and charge distribution (LCD) model. The model is a
   self-consistent combination of the nonideal competitive adsorption
   (NICA) equation and the CD-MUSIC model. The LCD model can describe
   simultaneously the concentration, pH, and salt dependency of the
   adsorption with a minimum of only three adjustable parameters.
   Furthermore, the model predicts the coadsorption of protons accurately
   for an extended range of conditions. Surface speciation calculations
   show that almost all hydroxyl groups of the adsorbed FA molecules are
   involved in outer sphere complexation reactions. The carboxylic groups
   of the adsorbed FA molecule form inner and outer sphere complexes.
   Furthermore, part of the carboxylate groups remain noncoordinated and
   deprotonated. Copyright (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The role of humic acid in the transport of negatively charged colloids
   through porous media was examined. Adsorption of humic acid on latex
   colloids and silica collectors reduced the deposition of suspended
   particles and enhanced the reentrainment of deposited particles in
   porous media. These effects are considered to arise from additional
   electrostatic and steric contributions to the repulsive interaction
   energy due to the adsorption of negatively charged humic acid on both
   the suspended particles and the media collectors. At low ionic strength
   reversible deposition in shallow secondary minima is hypothesized to be
   the principal attachment mechanism, independent of the presence of humic
   acid. It is proposed that, under these solution conditions, particle
   deposition and reentrainment are the result of a dynamic process, in
   which particles are continuously captured and released from secondary
   minima. At higher ionic strengths, deposition may be regarded as a
   combination of two mechanisms: capture in the primary well and capture
   in the secondary minimum. Theoretical calculations of the attachment
   efficiency were conducted using two existing mathematical models. The
   first model is based on deposition in the primary well (interaction
   force boundary layer, IFBL), and the second model is based on the
   Maxwell kinetic theory and deposition in the secondary minimum (Maxwell
   model). Simulations conducted with the Maxwell model provide
   significantly better fits of the experimental results than those
   conducted with the IFBL model.

AB To evaluate the risk of contaminant transport by mobile colloids, it
   seems essential to understand how colloids and associated pollutants
   behave during their migration through uncontaminated soil or
   groundwater. In this study, we investigated at pH 4 the influence of
   flow velocity, humic acid, solution Ca2+ concentrations, and trace
   metals (Pb2+, Cu2+) on the transport and deposition of kaolinite
   particles through a pure crystalline quartz sand as porous medium. A
   short-pulse chromatographic technique was used to measure colloid
   deposition. Adsorption of humic acid to the kaolinite increase its
   negative surface charge and then decrease colloid deposition.
   Experiments with different flow rates showed that humic-coated kaolinite
   colloid deposition followed a first-order kinetic rate law. The
   deposition rate coefficients of humic-coated kaolinite colloids increase
   with increasing Ca2+ concentration in the suspension. The effect of
   trace metals on the mobility is studied by injecting two suspensions
   with different concentrations of Pb2+ and Cu2+. At very low cation
   concentration, the fraction of colloids retained is low and roughly
   independent of the nature of divalent cations. At high concentration,
   the deposition is higher and depends on the affinity of divalent cations
   toward humic-coated kaolinite colloids. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

   on the transport of colloidal particles through a sand-packed column.
   Polystyrene latex particles with a sulfate functional group were used as
   model colloids. The concentrations of both the inlet solution and the
   effluent solutions were measured during each experimental run.
   Breakthrough curves were obtained by taking the ratios of each effluent
   sample concentration to the inlet solution concentration. In the absence
   of humic acid, the results indicate that increasing the concentration of
   Ca2+ increases particle attachment to the sand, thus causing decreased
   transport rates of latex particles through the porous bed matrix. Once 4
   mg/l humic acid was added to the system, changes were observed in the
   effect that Ca2+ has on latex particle breakthrough. In a system
   containing calcium, increasing the humic acid concentration was shown to
   reduce particle attachment and increase transport rates. In the absence
   of calcium, the ratios for the outlet-to-inlet concentrations were
   similar for each concentration of humic acid. The electrophoretic
   mobility was also measured in order to determine the role of
   electrostatic repulsion in the latex particle transport. The
   electrophoretic mobility of the latex particles was found to be
   dependent on humic acid concentration in the absence of Ca2+ but not in
   its presence.

   (epsilon (280)), probably reflecting greater aromaticity. Over the first
   6 h of adsorption experiments, adsorbed organic carbon increased and
   weight average molecular weight (M-w) of the organic matter remaining in
   solution decreased, consistent with slower adsorption of higher
   molecular weight components. Observations of fractionation upon
   adsorption agreed well with a field study showing lower M-w and lower
   epsilon (280) organic matter in deeper ground water relative to surface
   and shallow ground water. Copyright (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In this research, the influence of two natural organic polymers
   (polysaccharide and humic acid) on the stability of colloidal aggregates
   was examined. The primary objective of this research was to determine
   whether addition of organic matter to flee suspensions results in the
   fragmentation or stabilization of aggregates. A second objective was to
   determine how the size of aggregates and the composition of organic
   matter influence the floc breakup or stabilization process. It was found
   that the stability of aggregates depended on the type of organic
   material present as well as hoc size. For example, humic acid increased
   the stability of aggregates more effectively than polysaccharides of
   larger size. It was also found that the addition of humic acid or
   polysaccharide generally decreased the rate of coagulation of small
   aggregates but had less influence on large aggregates. In no case did
   the addition of polysaccharide or humic acid result in the fragmentation
   of particle aggregates. The existence of strong interparticle forces
   within flocs prevented aggregate breakup upon adsorption of natural
   organic polymers. The results presented here provide important new
   information regarding the influence of NOM on the behavior of particles
   in aquatic systems. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Experiments were conducted to compare the affinity and reactivity of
   three different minerals for natural organic matter (NOM) in forest
   floor leachate (FFL) from hardwood and pine forests. The FFLs were
   acidic (pH 4) with ionic strengths of 1.4 mM (hardwood) and 1.1 mM
   (pine), and they contained larger organic molecules (weight average
   molecular weights [Mw] = 5-6 kDa) than has: been reported recently for
   surface waters using similar methods. A synthetic diluent solution was
   prepared to match the inorganic chemistry of the FFL and to provide a
   range of initial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (0-140 g
   C m(-3)) for reaction with goethite (alpha -FeOOH), birnessite (delta
   -MnO2) and smectite (montmorillonite, SWy-2) in suspension, and in
   corresponding blanks.
   A variety of macroscopic and spectroscopic methods were employed to show
   that reaction with the three minerals resulted in distinctly different
   NOM adsorption, fractionation and transformation patterns. Goethite
   exhibited a steep initial slope in the adsorption isotherm and a maximum
   retention of 10.5 g C kg(-1). The isotherm for montmorillonite was more
   linear, but equal amounts of C were adsorbed to goethite and
   montmorillonite (per unit sorbent mass) at maximum DOG. Whereas
   preferential uptake of high Mw, aromatic constituents via ligand
   exchange was observed for goethite, compounds of lower than average Mw
   were retained on montmorillonite: and no preference fur aromatic
   moieties was observed. Birnessite, which has an isoelectric point of pH
   < 2, retained low amounts of organic C (<2 g C kg(-1)) but exhibited the
   highest propensity for oxidative transformation of the NOM. The data
   indicate that fractionation behavior of NOM is dependent on mineral
   surface chemistry in addition to sorbent affinity fur organic C. This
   work also emphasizes the fact that abiotic transformation reactions must
   be considered in studies of NOM interaction with Fe(III) and Mn(IV)
   containing solid phases. Copyright (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Mineral-bound humic substances modify the surfaces of clay minerals.
   changing the nature and number of adsorption sites for contaminants. Due
   to their effect on the surface charge of colloidal particles they can
   also change the particles mobility and thus their transport behavior. In
   this paper the influence of natural organic matter on the zetapotential
   of kaolinite and montmorillonite is shown. Adsorption experiments with
   kaolinite and montmorillonite show that due to adsorption the humic
   substances are fractionated. The equilibrium pH value does not influence
   the fractionation due to adsorption. Large hydrophobic molecules showed
   the strongest affinity towards the clay surfaces. Substances with a
   small apparent molecular size and a high content of carboxylic
   functional groups made up the non-adsorbing fraction of the NOM. Ca2+
   had no measurable effect on the adsorption. The low influence of the
   adsorbed NOM on the zetapotential of the clay minerals suggests physical
   adsorption as the predominant adsorption mechanism. (C) 2000 Elsevier

AB The adsorption of fulvic acid by goethite was determined experimentally
   as a function of concentration, pH, and ionic strength. The data were
   described with the CD-MUSIC model of Hiemstra and Van Riemsdijk (1996),
   which allows the distribution of charge of the bound fulvate molecule
   over a surface region. Simultaneously, the concentration, pH, and salt
   dependency of the binding of fulvic acid can be described. Using the
   same parameters, the basic charging behavior of the goethite in the
   absence of fulvic acid could be described well. The surface species used
   in the model indicate that inner sphere coordination of carboxylic
   groups of the fulvate molecule is important at low pH, whereas at high
   pH the outer sphere coordination with reactive groups of the fulvate
   molecule with high proton affinity is important. Copyright (C) 1999

AB A conceptual model for the adsorption of linear, flexible weak
   polyelectrolytes on oxide surfaces is applied to the adsorption and
   conformation of natural organic matter (NOM) on hematite. The
   polyelectrolytic nature of NOM and the complexation (specific)
   interactions between the functional groups of NOM and oxide surface
   sites are taken into account in this model. Model results are compared
   with experimental data for adsorption of Suwannee River humic acid on
   hematite at different pHs and ionic strengths. When the initial surface
   charge of hematite is positive (termed the oppositely charged case), the
   experimental adsorption density and adsorbed hydrodynamic layer
   thickness decrease with increasing pH and with decreasing ionic
   strength. When the initial surface charge is negative (termed the
   similarly charged case), the experimental adsorption density decreases
   with increasing pH and the adsorbed hydrodynamic layer thickness
   increases with increasing pH. Model results with a reaction represented
   by >MeOH + L- = >MeOHL- agree with the experimental adsorption density
   and adsorbed hydrodynamic layer thickness for the oppositely charged
   case, and the adsorption density for the similarly charged case. This
   suggests that the adsorption of NOM on hematite is related to the
   polyelectrolytic nature of NOM and to the complexation interactions
   between the neutral surface sites of oxides and the deprotonated
   functional groups of NOM. The effects of solution chemistry on the
   adsorption of NOM are due to a great extent to its effects on surface
   and NOM speciation, which can influence the specific interactions
   between NOM and surface sites. Model calculations also indicate that for
   the oppositely charged case, the adsorbed NOM overcompensates for the
   positive charge of the hematite surface. Simulations of electric
   potential and volume fraction indicate an interrelationship between the
   adsorption of NOM and interfacial properties. Copyright (C) 1999

AB The influence of humate, gallate and salicylate on the surface charge
   character and particle aggregation of permanently and/or conditionally
   charged clay and oxide minerals (montmorillonite, kaolinite and

   indifferent electrolyte. pH-dependent surface charging of minerals were
   determined by acid-base titration. The pH- and ionic strength dependent
   particle aggregation was measured in both the absence and presence of
   organic anions by means of dynamic light scattering (DLS). Relatively
   small amount of organic anions, less than one species per nm(2),
   adsorbed on the AI-OH surface sites of minerals induces a significant

   acids are adsorbed onto 6 nm compared to 16 nn nanocrystalline titania
   particles. A Langmuir adsorption model modified to include the
   dependence of interfacial tension (interfacial free energy) on particle
   size predicts an increase in the adsorption constant (K-ads) as the
   crystallite size decreases; in agreement with the experimental results.
   The increase in K-ads arises predominantly from the increased

AB Natural organic matter (NOM) consists of a complex mixture of organic
   molecules; previous studies have suggested that preferential sorption of
   higher molecular weight, more hydrophobic, and more aromatic components
   may lead to fractionation of the NOM pool upon passage through porous
   media. Our work expands upon previous studies by quantifying the change
   in solution-phase weight average molecular weight (M-w) upon sorption of
   bulk (rather than isolated) surface water NOM from the Suwannee River
   (SR) and the Great Dismal Swamp (GDS) to goethite and kaolinite at
   different sorption densities and at pH 4, 22 degrees C. High pressure
   size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was used to quantify changes in
   M-w upon sorption, and molar absorptivities at lambda = 280 nm were used
   to approximate changes in solution NOM aromaticity. Two SR water samples
   were used, with M-w = 2320 and 2200 Da; a single GDS sample was used,
   with M-w = 1890 Da. The SR NOM was slightly more hydrophobic and
   aromatic. These differences were reflected in greater sorption of SR NOM
   than GDS NOM. Both surface water NOMs showed a much greater affinity for
   goethite than for kaolinite. HPSEC analysis of the NOM remaining in
   solution after 24 h reaction time with goethite revealed that the
   largest changes in solution phase M(w)s (decreases by 900-1700 Da)
   occurred at relatively low equilibrium sorbate concentrations
   (approximately 5-20 mg C 1(-1)); the decrease in solution M-w suggested
   that reactive surface sites were occupied disproportionately by large
   and intermediate size NOM moieties. At higher equilibrium NOM
   concentrations (> 20 mg C 1(-1)), as percent adsorption decreased, M-w
   in solution was similar to original samples. A smaller decrease in
   solution NOM M-w (300-500 Da at 10-20 mg C 1(-1) similar to 100 Da at >
   20 mg) also occurred upon sorption to kaolinite. Overall, our results
   showed that factors las related to NOM composition, clay mineral surface
   properties, and position along the sorption isotherm) which promote a
   higher percent sorption lead to the most pronounced decreases in
   solution M-w. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

   C/L) of humic fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolated from
   the Florida Everglades. At low Hg concentrations (less than or equal to
   5 x 10(-8) M), DOM prevented the precipitation of metacinnabar. At
   moderate Hg concentrations (5 x 10(-5) M), DOM inhibited the aggregation
   of colloidal metacinnabar (Hg passed through a 0.1 mu m filter but was
   removed by centrifugation). At Hg concentrations greater than 5 x 10(-4)
   M, mercury formed solid metacinnabar particles that were removed from
   solution by a 0.1 mu m filter. Organic matter rich in aromatic moieties
   was preferentially removed with the solid. Hydrophobic organic acids
   (humic and fulvic acids) inhibited aggregation better than hydrophilic
   organic acids. The presence of chloride, acetate, salicylate, EDTA, and
   cysteine did not inhibit the precipitation or aggregation of
   metacinnabar. Calcium enhanced metacinnabar aggregation even in the
   presence of DOM, but the magnitude of the effect was dependent on the
   concentrations of DOM, Hg, and Ca. Inhibition of metacinnabar
   precipitation appears to be a result of strong DOM-Hg binding.
   Prevention of aggregation of colloidal particles appears to be caused by
   adsorption of DOM and electrostatic repulsion.

AB Adsorption equilibria were studied with RO isolates for both activated
   carbon and activated alumina. Maximum carbon loadings on the order of 65
   mg/g DOC were obtained, while the maximum loadings of activated alumina
   were about 30 mg/g DOG. In the latter case the slope of the isotherms
   was generally steeper, indicating weaker adsorbabilities of some of the
   NOM compounds on the metal oxide adsorbent. Since NOM must be regarded
   as a multi-component system with respect to adsorption, the data were
   evaluated by the adsorption analysis procedure. The results were used
   for a theoretical comparison of NOM adsorption based on the same initial
   concentration of all samples. The method of colloidal titration was
   applied to the RO isolates in the range pH = 3-8. Poly-DADMAC was used
   as a cationic polymer, and a streaming current instrument was used for
   end point detection. The results which are termed anionic colloidal
   charge (ACC) values increase with increasing pH for pH = 3-6 while they
   are about constant for pH = 6-8. At the samples' original pH, the
   specific ACC values found range from 5.2 to 7.6 meq/g DOG. Mass transfer
   coefficients for NOM adsorption on granular activated carbon were
   determined for both RO and EVAP isolates, respectively. The data were
   used to derive effective diffusivities for each sample. The results
   differ by a factor of about 2 with the Maridalsvann sample having the
   highest and the Humex sample having the lowest diffusivity. Furthermore,
   the results for the EVAP isolates are in 8 of 9 cases higher than for
   the RO samples. Based on a comparison with known macromolecules, average
   molecular weight values were estimated to be on the order of 700-4800

AB The adsorption of humic acid to mineral particles can be characterized
   by specific and electrostatic interactions and by adsorption
   fractionation. In this paper we focus on adsorption fractionation and
   the influence of the polydispersity (with respect to size) of humic
   acids on the adsorption process and the shape of the isotherms at
   different pH values. In the previous paper the effects of electrostatic
   interactions were described. The adsorption from a mixture of two humic
   substances, purified Aldrich humic acid (PAHA) and Laurentian fulvic
   acid, on nonporous hematite is studied. It is shown that, in time, the
   large humic acid molecules replace the readily adsorbed, small, fulvic
   acid molecules. Preferential adsorption of large humic molecules over
   small ones also affects the shape of the adsorption isotherm of a single
   humic acid. After a high affinity start, the adsorbed amount of PAHA
   gradually increases with increasing humic acid concentration. This is
   mainly due to an increasing adsorption fractionation. For a certain
   concentration in solution the effect of the fractionation increases with
   increasing adsorbed amounts. This explains why for PAHA the
   polydispersity effect is much stronger at pH 4 than at pH 9 where the
   adsorption is lower. To obtain a general impression of the effects of
   polydispersity on the adsorption of weak polyelectrolytes on a variably
   charged surface, calculations are presented using a
   self-consistent-field theory. The calculated adsorption of a mixture of
   two acidic polyelectrolytes, that (mainly) differ in size, onto an
   oppositely charged hematite type surface confirm the trends found for
   humics: adsorption fractionation occurs, and the effect of the
   fractionation on the isotherm increases with decreasing pH. The
   calculations also show that the area-to-volume ratio affects the
   isotherm and results in an adsorption/desorption hysteresis.

AB Time-resolved dynamic light scattering was used to investigate the
   influence of pH and adsorbed humic acid on the coagulation kinetics of
   kaolinite clay colloids. Stability ratios, defined as the experimental
   fast coagulation rate divided by the coagulation rate of the sample
   under consideration, were determined from the initial increases in
   average hydrodynamic radius with time. Pure kaolinite exhibited fast
   coagulation (stability ratio W = 1) at all ionic strengths (0.001 to 1 M
   NaClO4) when suspension pH was below 5.8. Above pH 5.8, coagulation
   rates were significantly reduced (W > 1) and W exhibited pronounced
   ionic strength dependence. The observed behavior is explained by
   edge-to-face heterocoagulation by electrostatic attractive forces at low
   pH and electrostatic stabilization at high pH. The transition in
   coagulation behavior occurs at the point of zero charge (PZC) of the
   kaolinite edge surfaces near pH 5.8. Small additions of humic acid at pH
   4 resulted in edge charge reversal from positive to negative and
   substantially reduced coagulation rates (W > 1); similar behavior was
   observed at pH 6. Relating the observed stability ratios W to zeta
   potentials suggests that at low to medium ionic strength (less than or
   equal to 0.01 M NaClO4) the stabilizing effect of adsorbed humic acid is
   purely electrostatic. However, at high ionic strength (greater than or
   equal to 0.1 M) steric stabilization may also play a role. (C) 1998

AB The adsorption of humic acid to mineral particles can be characterized
   by specific and electrostatic interactions and by polydispersity
   effects. In this paper we focus on the adsorbed amount and discuss the
   importance of specific and electrostatic interactions. The adsorption of
   purified Aldrich humic acid onto hematite has been measured as a
   function of pH and salt concentration as well as in the presence of two
   cadmium concentrations. Besides the adsorbed amount, the thickness of
   the adsorbed layer has also been studied. The experimental results are
   discussed in relation to the polyelectrolyte behavior of the humic acid.
   At high pH and low salt concentration the adsorption is low and the
   humic acid molecules are adsorbed relatively flat on the surface. At low
   pH and high salt concentration a substantial fraction of the adsorbed
   humic acid is not in direct contact with the surface, which results in a
   relatively high adsorbed amount and a large layer thickness. PAHA
   adsorption at not too low pH leads to an overcompensation of the
   hematite charge and to the development of an electrostatic barrier
   against further adsorption. Substantial PAHA adsorption occurs at the
   point of zero charge of hematite; this shows that besides electrostatic
   interactions also specific interactions are important. Calculations
   based on the SCF theory for polyelectrolyte adsorption show that the
   trends with respect to the adsorbed amounts and layer thickness as a
   function of pH and salt concentration correspond well with the measured
   trends for PAHA. This suggest that at least partly the humic acid
   adsorption behavior is related to its polyelectrolyte character. Both
   experiments and theory indicate that a well-developed layer arises upon
   adsorption and that lateral interactions within this layer determine to
   a large extent the adsorption process.

AB The adsorption of several fractions of humic and fulvic acids on silver
   colloids was studied by means of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.
   The short-range mechanism of this technique was applied in the
   determination of the chemical groups which are directly attached to the
   metallic surface. Adsorption of humic substances was found to be very
   sensitive to pH, to the electric charge of both the humic substances and
   the metallic surface, and to the size of the adsorbed macromolecules.
   From the obtained results, a model for the adsortion mechanism of these
   macromolecules is proposed on the basis of a conformational change and a
   variation of their electric charge on modifying the pH. FTIR spectra of
   some of the extracted fractions and SERS spectra of o-, m-, and
   p-hydroxybenzoic acids, used as molecular models for humic substances,
   were also obtained in order to better attribute the SERS spectra of
   these humic substances. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB The adsorption of Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) and a synthetic
   organic polymer, polymaleic acid (PMA) by goethite was studied. The
   adsorption density of the sorbates decreased with increasing pH, and the
   data could best be described by the Langmuir adsorption equation. The
   number- and weight-averaged molecular weights, M-w and M-n, of the
   sorbates in the solution phase before and after adsorption by goethite
   were measured by high-pressure size exclusion chromatography. The
   observed decreases in the M-n and M-w of SRFA in the solution phase
   after adsorption demonstrated that fractionation of SRFA on the basis of
   molecular size occured. UV molar absorptivities measured at 280 nm also
   decreased, which suggests that the more aromatic moieties are
   preferentially adsorbed. Potentiometric titrations conducted on SRFA
   revealed changes in the conditional acidity constants (expressed as the
   negative logarithm, pK(a)) of the fulvic acid after adsorption. The
   increased pK(a) value of the humic material remaining in the solution
   after adsorption implies that the strongly sorbing compounds possessed
   stronger acidic functional groups. Fractionation of PMA after
   adsorption, however, did not occur to the same extent compared to SRFA
   because PMA is relatively homogeneous. The experimental results confirm
   that molecular weight, aromaticity, and organic acidity are major
   factors controlling the fractionation of natural organic matter (NOM) by
   adsorption onto hydrous mineral oxides. PMA, a relatively uniform and
   less polydisperse organic polymer, may serve as an endmember material
   characteristic of NOM that exhibits the least amount of fractionation
   upon adsorption. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Organic matter has a great influence over the fate of inorganic colloids
   in surface waters, The chemical nature and structure of natural organic
   matter (NOM) will be an important factor in determining whether colloids
   will be stabilised or destabilised by NOM. Under environmentally
   relevant conditions, the ubiquitous fulvic acids are likely to be
   responsible for coating and imparting a negative charge to colloids, If
   the adsorbed polyelectrolyte coating produces an increase in absolute
   surface potential, it will act to stabilise colloids in the water
   column. On the other hand, colloidal organic carbon, especially
   chain-like structures, has been shown to be involved in the aggregation
   of inorganic colloids through the formation of bridges. It is highly
   probable that both adsorption and bridging flocculation are occurring
   simultaneously in the natural aquatic environment. The importance of
   each process depends directly on the nature and concentration of organic
   matter in the system and indirectly on the productivity of the lake, its
   hydrological pathways, temporal variations, temperature, etc. The
   present paper reports such results and emphasises the need to
   discriminate the different kinds of NOM. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Different organic compounds or fractions of natural organic matter (NOM)
   show different adsorption affinities (K) and capacities (qm) on mineral
   surfaces. We hypothesize that these different organic compounds or
   fractions compete for adsorption when surface adsorption sites are
   limited. In this study, competitive adsorption of binary mixtures of
   Suwannee River NOM (SR-NOM), polyacrylic acid (PAA), phthalic acid, and
   salicylic acid on iron oxide was investigated at a constant
   solid:solution ratio, temperature, and pressure, but at varying C weight
   fractions, pH, and solution concentrations of the mixture. Results
   revealed that, in general, PAA is the most competitive whereas SR-NOM is
   more competitive than phthalic and salicylic acids. The competitive
   adsorption of these organic compounds is pH-dependent. Ar pH < 4, PAA
   becomes less competitive than SR-NOM or phthalic and salicylic acids.
   The competition among these organic compounds may be related to their
   carboxyl functional groups and their molecular structure. The overall
   strong competitiveness of PAA at pH > 4 in comparison with other
   organics is attributed to its high carboxyl density and linear molecular
   structure, which promote strong surface complexation with iron oxide.
   Because of the heterogeneity or polydispersity of NOM, this research
   indicates that NOM partitioning and transport in the subsurface soil
   environment are influenced by the dynamic competitive interactions
   between NOM subcomponents (or fractions). This process ultimately
   influences the distribution, interaction, and cotransport of
   contaminants and mineral colloids that are associated with NOM.

AB Adsorption of natural organic matter (NOM) onto particles contributes to
   their colloidal stability and inhibits coagulation in water treatment.
   Ozone has been shown to assist in the destabilization of particles
   during water treatment by several hypothesized mechanisms. The goal of
   this research was to study the effects of ozone on NOM-coated particles
   in model (synthetic) waters to determine prevailing mechanisms and to
   quantify the effects of different variables. The experimental system
   included particles, aqueous phase NOM in equilibrium with particle phase
   (sorbed) NOM, and a background solution chemistry reflecting pH, ionic
   strength, and potentially influential ions (e.g., calcium, bicarbonate).
   Particle stability was assessed through electrophoretic mobility
   measurements while particle aggregation was assessed through use of a
   collision efficiency factor (a) under fluid shear mixing conditions.
   Changes in molecular weight, acidity, and complexation capacity of NOM
   (aqueous and mineral-bound) with calcium was studied before and after
   ozonation. Oxalic acid was used as a model compound for ozonated NOM. It
   was found that ozone-induced particle destabilization occurred only in
   the presence of calcium. Based on the overall results, it is proposed
   that the ozone-induced particle destabilization observed in our system
   (with calcium present) is due to the following: (a) an increase in
   calcium association with ozonated NOM constituents thereby inhibiting
   adsorption of anionic species onto the alumina surface and (b) a
   production of more ligand sites by ozone on the surface-sorbed NOM
   leading to increased NOM complexation with calcium. These effects lead
   to a reduction in particle stability through surface charge reduction.

AB Photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) has been employed to monitor the
   size evolution of aggregates of hematite particles in the presence of
   fairly monodisperse polyacrylic acid (PAA). The aggregation rate
   increases to a maximum value and then decreases as the PAA concentration
   is increased. This stability variation results mainly from a charge
   reversal of polymer coated particles, as revealed by electrophoretic
   mobility measurements. The maximum rate, occurring at low magnitudes of
   zeta potentials, is found to be identical to that induced by KCl above
   the critical coagulation concentration. Thus, it seems that polymer
   bridging is not important compared to the charge neutralization
   mechanism in the diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) regime. Dynamic
   scaling yields the same fractal dimension for DLA aggregates induced by
   both PAA and KCI. This suggests that the polymer chains situated between
   contacting particles in an aggregate completely collapse on the surface
   so that the interparticle distance hardly increases in the presence of a
   flexible polyelectrolyte. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.

AB Column filtration experiments were conducted to determine the deposition
   kinetics of the humic matter-coated hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) colloids on
   quartz grains in the presence of Ca2+. Three well-characterized humic
   substances were used. Our results indicate that several mechanisms are
   responsible for the differences in the attachment efficiencies of these
   particles. The relative importance of each mechanism varies depending
   upon the type of humic matter used. Systems coated with the peat humic
   acid, which is the least acidic, the most hydrophobic and has the
   highest molecular size of all the samples used here, had the highest
   stability at approximately [Ca2+] < 0.002 M, despite their lower
   electrophoretic mobilities. This behavior may be attributed to the
   greater electrosteric interactions brought about by the adsorbed humic
   acid. At higher Ca2+ concentrations, however, the stability of the peat
   humic acid-coated systems was drastically reduced owing to the effect of
   cation bridging and/or hydrophobic interactions. Our experimental set up
   does not allow unequivocal determination of the underlying cause of the
   observed differences between the attachment efficiencies of the
   particles coated with the two fulvic acids used here. Such differences
   may be controlled by electrostatic, hydrophobic or electrosteric
   interactions, or a complex combination of these.

AB Natural organic matter (NOM) is a complex mixture of different organic
   components (or fractions), yet few studies have examined the fractional
   adsorption of NOM on mineral surfaces.  In this study, we fractionated
   NOM into hydrophobic (HbA) and hydrophilic (HL) subcomponents and two
   size fractions (with nominal molecular weights cut off at 3000 (3 K)
   dalton in an attempt to elucidate the adsorption and desorption
   mechanisms of NOM on iron oxide surfaces.  Results indicated that, on a
   C weight basis, larger size HbA fraction was preferentially adsorbed
   (with a higher adsorption affinity and capacity) over smaller size HL
   fraction.  However, on an O weight basis, less HbA fraction was adsorbed
   relative to the HL fraction, because HbA contained about 1.34 times more
   C but 0.82 times less O than the HL.  These observations are consistent
   with results which indicate that only limited adsorption sites are
   available on the iron oxide surfaces and that the mechanism of HbA and
   HL adsorption was dominated by surface complexation-ligand exchange. 
   FTIR and NMR spectroscopy and studies with several substituted benzoic
   acids/phenols further indicated that carboxyl and hydroxyl functional
   groups of these NOM fractions were actively involved in the reactions,
   and the steric arrangement of these functional groups may have played an
   important role in determining the adsorption of NOM fractions. 
   Desorption studies indicated that the adsorbed NOM macromolecules on
   iron oxide surfaces were strongly bound at a given pH and ionic
   composition, resulting in a strong adsorption-desorption hysteresis. 
   One possible explanation for the observed hysteresis is that the
   solution composition and equilibria are not identical between adsorption
   and desorption phases of the experiment because of preferential or
   selective adsorption of certain NOM fractions.  This study implies that,
   due to the polydispersity of NOM, the competitive and fractional
   adsorption-desorption of NOM subcomponents must be considered in order
   to better predict NOM partitioning between the solution and solid
   phases, and, therefore, the transport behavior of NOM in the subsurface
   soil environment.

AB Using a particle counter technique, we investigated the fragmentation
   process of aggregates of polystyrene sulfonate latices induced by the
   adsorption of polyvinylpyridine at the particle-liquid interface by
   determining the aggregate size distribution c(x, t), concentration of
   aggregates of size x, and the weight S(t) and number N(t) average sizes
   at time t. The fragmentation of two typical aggregates were studied. The
   first aggregates obtained under conditions of perikinetic
   diffusion-limited aggregation (1 M NaCl and pH 3.0 medium) were
   transferred to aqueous polyelectrolyte solutions at different
   concentrations in the presence of 0.15 M NaCl and at pH 3.0. The second
   aggre gates obtained under conditions of reaction-limited aggregation
   (0.15 M NaCl and pH 3.0 medium) were transferred to aqueous
   polyelectrolyte solutions in the presence of 0.0225 M NaCl and at pH
   3.0. We determined that fragmentation is a very slow process. The size
   distribution of the fragments was self-similar and the variation in the
   number average size N(t) and the weight average size S(t) as a function
   of time followed dynamic scaling laws whose exponents depended on the
   mode of formation and the initial size of the aggregates, as well as on
   the concentration and the molecular weight of the polymer. Using Cheng
   and Redner's theory (Phys. Rev. Lett. 60, 2450 (1988); J. Phys. A: Math
   Gen. 23, 1233 (1990)), we calculated the rate of aggregate breakup,
   which was found to be independent of the initial size of the aggregates
   and of the polyelectrolyte concentration. The mode of aggregate
   formation and the molecular weight of the polymer in the fragmenting
   medium were found to fix the rate of breakup and the fragment size
   distribution. The discrepancies between the rate of aggregate break-up
   and the rates of fragmentation determined from the variation of the
   average sizes were attributed to the existence of a concomitant
   aggregation during fragmentation. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.

AB The adsorption of Suwannee River humic substances (HS) on colloidal-size
   aluminum oxide particles was examined as a function of solution
   chemistry.  The amount of humic acid (HA) or fulvic acid (FA) adsorbed
   decreased with increasing pH for all solutions of constant ionic
   strength.  In NaCl solutions at fixed pH values, the adsorption of HA
   and FA increased with increasing ionic strength.  The presence of Ca2+
   enhanced the adsorption of HA but had little effect on FA.  For
   identical solution conditions, the amount (by mass) of HA adsorbed to
   alumina was always greater than FA.  Adsorption densities for both HA
   and FA showed good agreement with the Langmuir equation, and
   interpretations of adsorption processes were made from the model
   parameters.  For FA, ligand exchange appears to be the dominant
   adsorption reaction for the conditions studied here.  Ligand exchange is
   also a major adsorption reaction for HA; however, other reactions
   contribute to adsorption for some solution compositions.  At high pH,
   cation and water bridging become increasingly important for HA
   adsorption with increasing amounts of Na+ and Ca2+, respectively.  At
   low to neutral pH values, increases in these same two cations make
   hydrophobic bonding more effective.  Calculations of HS carboxyl group
   densities in the adsorbed layer support the proposed adsorption
   reactions.  From the adsorption data it appears that fewer than 3.3
   HS-COO- groups per nm2 can be bound directly as inner-sphere complexes
   by the alumina surface.  We propose that the influence of aqueous
   chemistry on HS adsorption reactions, and therefore on the types of HS
   surface complexes formed, affects the formation and nature of organic
   coatings on mineral surfaces.

AB The adsorption of three humic substances isolated from the River Dodder
   (Eire) and one commercial humic acid (Aldrich) by six minerals was
   studied and found to be influenced by mineral type, the nature of the
   humics and by the solution characteristics. Adsorption was heavily
   pH-dependent, with lower uptake at higher pH values due to increased
   ionization of the humic substances. The amount of humic substances
   adsorbed was in the order: Aldrich humic acid > Dodder humic acid >
   Dodder fulvic acid > Dodder hydrophilic macromolecular acid
   corresponding to a decreasing aromatic carbon content and increasing O/C
   ratio. Desorption experiments showed Aldrich humic acid was the most
   difficult to be desorbed, followed by Dodder humic acid, Dodder fulvic
   acid then Dodder hydrophilic macromolecular acid. Humic uptake was found
   to increase with ionic strength due to the neutralization of charges on
   both mineral surfaces and humic substances, and more importantly, the
   compression of diffuse double layers; this also showed that van der
   Waals attraction is an important part of the interactive forces between
   humic substances and mineral particles. The amount of humic substances
   adsorbed varied with mineral type, particle size and surface area, with
   aluminium oxide having the highest capacity. The effect of temperature
   on humic adsorption was shown to vary with humic type and two types of
   reaction mechanism have been proposed responsible for the humic-clay
   interactions.

AB The adsorption and desorption mechanisms of natural organic matter (NOM)
   on mineral surfaces are not completely understood because of the
   heterogeneity and complexity of NOM and adsorbent surfaces. This study
   was undertaken to elucidate the interaction mechanisms between NOM and
   iron oxide surfaces and to develop a predictive model for NOM adsorption
   and desorption. Results indicated that ligand exchange between
   carboxyl/hydroxyl functional groups of NOM and iron oxide surfaces was
   the dominant interaction mechanism, especially under acidic or slightly
   acidic pH conditions. This conclusion was supported by the measurements
   of heat of adsorption (microcalorimetry), FTIR and C-13 NMR analysis,
   and competitive adsorption between NOM and some specifically adsorbed
   anions. A modified Langmuir model was proposed in which a surface
   excess-dependent affinity parameter was defined to account for a
   decreasing adsorption affinity with surface coverage due to the
   heterogeneity of NOM and adsorbent surfaces. With three adjustable
   parameters, the model is capable of describing a variety of adsorption
   isotherms. A hysteresis coefficient, h, was used to describe the
   hysteretic effect of adsorption reactions that, at h = 0, the reaction
   is completely reversible, whereas at h = 1, the reaction is completely
   irreversible. Fitted values of h for NOM desorption on iron oxide
   surfaces ranged from 0.72 to 0.92, suggesting that the adsorbed NOM was
   very difficult to be desorbed at a given pH and ionic composition. Our
   results imply that a better mechanistic understanding of the interaction
   between NOM and oxide surfaces is needed to improve our predictive
   capabilities in NOM transport and cotransport of contaminants associated
   with NOM or iron oxides.

AB The extent and kinetics of adsorption of a peat-derived humic substance
   (HS) onto a hydrophobic surface (mercury electrode) and a polar mineral
   surface (gamma-Al2O3 colloids) was studied. Adsorption on the
   Hg-electrode was assessed by directly measuring the change of the double
   layer capacitance caused by the adsorption of HS on the electrode
   surface through phase-selective a.c. polarography; the extent of
   adsorption of HS on the gamma-Al2O3-surface was monitored by determining
   the residual HS-concentration in solution.
   On both surfaces, HS is adsorbed strongly over a wide pH-range;
   hydrophobic interaction (i.e., expulsion from solution) prevails at the
   mercury surface while coordinative adsorption (ligand exchange),
   enhanced by hydrophobic effects, is the predominant mechanism at the
   oxide surface. Adsorption kinetics are characterized by an initial fast
   process, where even in dilute solutions (<1 mg HS L(-1)), a high surface
   coverage is attained initially. True adsorption equilibrium however,
   cannot be reached within hours. The slow approach to equilibrium is
   thought to be caused mainly by the polydispersity of HS resulting in
   fractionation processes, where presumably fast-adsorbing low-molecular
   weight compounds are successively displaced from the surface by
   slow-adsorbing compounds of higher molecular weight. Slow molecular
   rearrangements of HS-molecules at the interface cannot be ruled out,
   however.
   Our results suggest that adsorption of humic substances on mineral as
   well as hydrophobic aquatic surfaces may lead to a progressive and
   selective immobilization of certain fractions of humic substances. It is
   probable that the higher-molecular weight fractions accumulate at
   aquatic interfaces, whereas lower-molecular weight fractions, such as
   fulvic acid components, are more likely to remain in solution. This may
   have significant effects on the qualitative composition and reactivity
   of dissolved vs. particulate organic carbon and on the residence time of
   different fractions of humic substances in natural systems. In turn, the
   chemical reactivity of particle surfaces may also be influenced by
   different fractions of adsorbed humic substances.

AB Column filtration experiments, using quartz grains as the bed media,
   were conducted to study the deposition kinetics of hematite particles in
   the presence of three well-characterized humic substances. Two pH
   conditions, 5.2 and 7.4, were selected such that the humic matter was
   adsorbed to an originally positive and negative hematite surface,
   respectively. Background NaCl concentrations ranged from 0.015 to 0.1 M.
   The particle deposition rates, expressed in terms of initial
   experimental attachment efficiencies (alpha(exp)), depended on the
   magnitude of both electrostatic and steric repulsive interaction
   energies. For a given solution chemistry, values of alpha(exp) exhibited
   a strong dependence on the type of the humic matter, while
   electrophoretic mobility measurements were independent of the type of
   surface coating and were solely a function of the pH and NaCl
   concentration. The lowest values of alpha(exp) were obtained for
   particles coated with the largest molecular size humic material at all
   solution conditions. Their low attachment rates were attributed to
   greater steric interaction forces. Attachment efficiencies of hematite
   particles coated with two different fulvic acids were determined. It is
   proposed that differences in the attachment rates are related to
   differences in the surface conformations of the fulvic acids.

AB Size distribution of colloidal quartz and hematite (initial diameter
   140-190 nm and 70-360 nm, respectively) were determined by Photon
   Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS) in well-defined laboratory systems.
   Effects on the mean diameter and the size distribution were measured at
   various values of pH (2-12) and ionic strength (0.001-0.7 mol/1) in an
   inert medium (NaClO4). The effect of an aquatic fulvic acid on the
   stability of the colloids was included in the study. In the absence of
   fulvic acid the colloids flocculate at a pH close to pH(zpc) of the
   respective mineral. This increase in mean diameter is due to
   electrostatic interactions. Hematite colloids are also destabilised at a
   pH much below pH(zpc). The quartz colloids are stabilised in the
   presence of fulvic acid.  The hematite/fulvic acid systems are stable at
   high pH, but flocculate at low pH. Increasing ionic strength induces
   agglomeration of the quartz colloids at 0.1 mol/l, independently of the
   presence of fulvic acid (2 mg/1). Hematite is destabilised at 0.02 mg/l
   in the absence of fulvic acid, while in the presence of fulvic acid the
   colloids aggregate at ionic strength >0.07 mol/l.

AB Laboratory and field observations by several investigators indicate that
   natural organic matter (NOM) affects and probably controls the colloidal
   stability of particles in aquatic systems. The enhanced stability of
   particles in aquatic systems containing NOM is a consistent observation
   without a clear cause. In this work, the potential importance of the
   macromolecular nature of NOM was investigated using model systems. A
   mathematical model for the adsorption of linear, flexible
   polyelectrolytes was used to examine the effects of molecular weight,
   pH, and ionic strength on the conformations of these surrogates for NOM
   at interfaces in natural waters. Laboratory experiments involving
   submicron hematite particles, two anionic polyelectrolytes, and an
   aquatic NOM were used to examine the effects of solution composition on
   colloidal stability. Together, the results of the mathematical
   simulations and the laboratory experiments indicate that electrostatic
   effects dominate particle-particle interactions, but that the
   macromolecular nature of NOM can have direct influence under certain
   conditions. At low ionic strength, anionic polyelectrolytes affect the
   coagulation of positively charged particles by altering net surface
   charge in a way similar to specifically adsorbing, multivalent,
   monomeric anions. At high ionic strength (I greater-than-or-equal-to
   0.1), the conformational characteristics of adsorbed polyelectrolytes at
   the solid/water interface directly affect coagulation by expanding the
   effective distance of electrostatic repulsion between approaching
   particles, as well as by altering net surface charge. Non-electrostatic
   steric repulsion plays little or no role in the stabilization of
   hematite particles by the organic macromolecules used in this work.
   Calcium acts to destabilize hematite particles in the presence of the
   organic macromolecules, perhaps through a combination of specific
   chemical and charge effects.
