AB Agglomeration and disagglomeration processes are expected to play a key
   role on the fate of engineered nanoparticles in natural aquatic systems.
   These processes are investigated here in detail by studying first the
   stability of TiO2 nanoparticles in the presence of monovalent and
   divalent electrolytes at different pHs (below and above the point of
   zero charge of TiO2) and discussing the importance of specific divalent
   cation adsorption with the help of the DLVO theory as well as the
   importance of the nature of the counterions. Then the impact of one
   polysaccharide (alginate) on the stability of agglomerates formed under
   pH and water hardness representative of Lake Geneva environmental
   conditions is investigated. In these conditions the large TiO2
   agglomerates (diameter > 1 mu m) are positively charged due to Ca2+ and
   Mg2+ specific adsorption and alginate, which is negatively charged,
   adsorbs onto the agglomerate surface. Our results indicate that the
   presence of alginate at typical natural organic matter concentration
   (1-10 mg L-1) strongly modifies the TiO2 agglomerate (50 mg L-1)
   stability by inducing their partial and rapid disagglomeration. The
   importance of disagglomeration is found dependent on the alginate
   concentration with maximum of disagglomeration obtained for alginate
   concentration >= 8 mg L-1 and leading to 400 nm fragments. From an
   environmental point of view partial restabilization of TiO2 agglomerates
   in the presence of alginate constitutes an important outcome.
   Disagglomeration will enhance their transport and residence time in
   aquatic systems which is an important step in the current knowledge on
   risk assessment associated to engineered nanoparticles. (C) 2015

AB Nanoparticles enter soils through various pathways. In the soil, they
   undergo various interactions with the solution and the solid phase. We
   tested the following hypotheses using batch experiments: i) the
   colloidal stability of Ag NP increases through sorption of soil-borne
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) and thus inhibits aggregation; ii) the
   presence of DOM suppresses Ag oxidation; iii) the surface charge of Ag
   NP governs sorption onto soil particles. Citrate-stabilized and bare Ag
   NPs were equilibrated with (colloid-free) soil solution extracted from a
   floodplain soil for 24 h. Nanoparticles were removed through
   centrifugation. Concentrations of free Ag ions and DOC, the specific UV
   absorbance at a wavelength of 254 nm, and the absorption ratio
   alpha(254)/alpha(410) were determined in the supernatant. Nanoparticle
   aggregation was studied using time-resolved dynamic light scattering
   (DLS) measurement following the addition of soil solution and 1.5 mM
   Ca2+ solution. To study the effect of surface charge on the adsorption
   of Ag NP onto soil particles, bare and citrate-stabilized Ag NP,
   differing in the zeta potential, were equilibrated with silt at a
   solid-to-solution ratio of 1:10 and an initial Ag concentration range of
   30 to 320 mu g/L. Results showed that bare Ag NPs sorb organic matter,
   with short-chained organic matter being preferentially adsorbed over
   long-chained, aromatic organic matter. Stabilizing effects of organic
   matter only come into play at higher Ag NP concentrations. Soil solution
   inhibits the release of Ag+ ions, presumably due to organic matter
   coatings. Sorption to silt particles was very similar for the two
   particle types, suggesting that the surface charge does not control Ag
   NP sorption. Besides, sorption was much lower than in comparable studies
   with sand and glass surfaces. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

AB The widespread use of engineered inorganic nanoparticles (EINP) leads to
   a growing risk for an unintended release into the environment. Despite
   the good characterization of EINP in regard to their function scale and
   the application areas, there is still a gap of knowledge concerning
   their behaviour in the different environmental compartments. Due to
   their high surface to volume ratio, surface properties and existence or
   development of a coating are of high importance for their stability and
   transport behaviour. However, analytical methods to investigate organic
   coatings on nanoparticles in aqueous media are scarce. We used Raman
   microspectroscopy in combination with surface-enhanced Raman scattering
   (SERS) to investigate humic acid coatings on silver nanoparticles under
   environmentally relevant conditions and in real world samples. This
   setup is more challenging than previous mechanistic studies using SERS
   to characterize the humic acids in tailored settings where only one type
   of organic matter is present and the concentrations of the nanoparticles
   can be easily adjusted to the experimental needs. SERS offers the unique
   opportunity to work with little sample preparation directly with liquid
   samples, thus significantly reducing artefacts. SERS spectra of
   different natural organic matter brought into contact with silver
   nanoparticles indicate humic acid in close proximity to the
   nanoparticles. This coating was also present after several washing steps
   by centrifugation and resuspension in deionized water and after an
   increase in ionic strength. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   and titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles in surface waters and

   ultrafiltered (<10 kDa and <1 kDa) samples. Z-average particle sizes
   were measured after 1 h, 1 day and 1 week. AgNP-PVP was stable in all
   fractions of the samples and kept their original size around 60 nm over
   1 week. Agglomeration of AgNP-Cit and TiO2 was positively correlated
   with Ca2+ concentration, but dissolved organic carbon concentrations >2
   mg/L contributed to stabilizing these NP. Moreover, agglomeration of
   AgNP-Cit in the various organic matter fractions showed that high
   molecular weight organic compounds such as biopolymers provide
   stabilization in natural water. A generalized scheme for the

AB Interaction between engineered nanoparticles and natural organic matter
   is investigated by measuring the exchanged heat during binding process
   with isothermal titration calorimetry. TiO2 anatase nanoparticles and
   alginate are used as engineered nanoparticles and natural organic matter
   to get an insight into the thermodynamic association properties and
   mechanisms of adsorption and agglomeration. Changes of enthalpy, entropy
   and total free energy, reaction stoichiometry and affinity binding
   constant are determined or calculated at a pH value where the TiO2
   nanoparticles surface charge is positive and the alginate exhibits a
   negative structural charge. Our results indicate that strong TiO2
   alginate interactions are essentially entropy driven and enthalpically
   favorable with exothermic binding reactions. The reaction stoichiometry
   and entropy gain are also found dependent on the mixing order. Finally
   correlation is established between the binding enthalpy, the reaction
   stoichiometry and the zeta potential values determined by
   electrophoretic mobility measurements. From these results two types of
   agglomeration mechanisms are proposed depending on the mixing order.
   Addition of alginate in TiO2 dispersions is found to form agglomerates
   due to polymer bridging whereas addition of TiO2 in alginate promotes a
   more individually coating of the nanoparticles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) are currently one of the most
   prolifically used nanomaterials, resulting in an increasing likelihood
   of release to the environment. This is of concern as the potential
   toxicity of TiO2 NPs has been investigated in several recent studies.
   Research into their fate and behaviour once entering the environment is
   urgently needed to support risk assessment and policy development. In
   this study, we used a multi-method approach combining light scattering
   and field-flow fractionation techniques to assess both the aggregation
   behaviour and aggregate structure of TiO2 NPs in different river waters.
   Results showed that both the aggregate size and surface-adsorbed
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) were strongly related to the initial DOM
   concentration of the tested waters (i.e. R-2 > 0.90) suggesting that
   aggregation of TiO2 NPs is controlled by the presence and concentration
   of DOM. The conformation of the formed aggregates was also found to be
   strongly related to the surface-adsorbed DOM (i.e. R-2 > 0.95) with
   increasing surface-adsorbed DOM leading to more compact structures.
   Finally, the concentration of TiO2 NPs remaining in the supernatant
   after sedimentation of the larger aggregates was found to decrease
   proportionally with both increasing IS and decreasing DOM concentration,
   resulting in more than 95% sedimentation in the highest IS sample. (C)

AB Colloidal behavior of various nanoparticles (NPs) could be quite
   different under the influence of complicated water chemistry.
   Homoaggregations of four types of nanoparticles (NPs) were investigated
   with a focus on the effects of electrolyte ions, pH, and natural organic
   matter (NOM). Results show that critical coagulation concentrations
   (CCCs) of NaCl and CaCl2 for anatase TiO2, rutile TiO2, or CeO2 NPs were
   all inversely proportional to the valence of cations, following the
   Schulze-Hardy Rule, and homoaggregations of the three NPs were similarly
   inhibited by the presence of NOM within pH 3-9. Although the
   homoaggregation of Ag NPs was also increased as the concentration or
   valence of cations increased, the relationship between CCC and valence
   of the cations was far away from the Schulze-Hardy Rule: moreover, NOM
   only slightly increased CCC of CaCl2 and surprisingly decreased CCC of
   NaCl for Ag NPs. Excessively-adsorbed Cl- on the formed Ag-AgCI
   colloidal nucleus was detected, which could increase the
   electronegativity of Ag NPs and thus limit the aggregation effect of
   chlorides and the dispersion effect of NOM as well. These results are
   expected to increase our knowledge on the colloidal behavior and fate of
   NPs in aquatic environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB With the proliferation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), their potential
   entry into the environment has attracted increasing concern. Although
   photochemical transformation is an important fate of AgNPs in aquatic
   environments due to their strong light absorption, little is known about
   the evolution and transformation mechanisms of AgNPs. This study
   investigated the morphological evolution and reconstruction of AgNPs
   during photoconversion in the presence of natural organic matter (NOM).
   In the dark, the AgNPs formed chain-like structures through bridging
   effects with NOM at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mg/L, and the proportion
   of Ag+ in solution in the presence of 10 mg/L NOM was reduced by roughly
   half compared with that in the absence of NOM. Under irradiation, NOM
   participated in the photoreaction of AgNPs and can decelerate the
   photoreaction of AgNPs via several mechanisms, including light
   attenuation, the formation of a NOM coating, and competing with Ag for
   photons. Additionally, NOM can substitute for citrate as a stabilizing
   agent to compensate for the loss of AgNP stability due to citrate
   mineralization under extended irradiation, producing stable triangular
   nanosilver in aquatic environments. This study sheds light on the
   behavioral differences of AgNPs in different aquatic systems, which
   create uncertainties and difficulties in assessing the environmental
   risks of AgNPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Once released into the aquatic environment, nanoparticles (NPs) are
   expected to interact (e.g., dissolve, agglomerate, settle), with
   important consequences for particle fate and toxicity. However, a clear
   understanding of how environmental factors influence the toxicity and
   fate of NPs in the environment is still in its infancy. In this study, a
   second order central composite circumscribed design (CCCD) was employed
   to systematically explore how different combinations of pH, hardness,
   and natural organic matter (NOM) in receiving water affect the
   hydrodynamic diameter, surface charge (zeta potential), and release of
   free Cu2+ from CuO-NPs under a range of environmentally realistic
   conditions. The results clearly showed that all three CuO-NP properties
   varied markedly as functions of pH, hardness and dissolved NOM,
   confirming that agglomeration and the extent of release of free Cu2+
   largely depend on the surrounding environmental conditions. The response
   of hydrodynamic diameter, but not zeta potential, to water quality
   parameters was highly time dependent, showing very different patterns on
   day 2 and day 10. The approach used in this study can contribute to
   improving understanding of how, and to what extent, environmental
   factors affect the physicochemical properties of CuO-NPs once they enter
   aquatic environments. This understanding can help to predict the
   conditions under which CuO-NPs are likely to become problematic, which
   can inform management and mitigation actions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

AB The colloidal stability of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in natural
   aquatic environments influences their transport and environmental
   persistence, while their dissolution to Ag+ influences their toxicity to
   organisms. Here, we characterize the colloidal stability, dissolution
   behavior, and toxicity of two industrially relevant classes of AgNPs
   (i.e., AgNPs stabilized by Citrate or polyvinylpyrrolidone) after
   exposure to natural organic matter (NOM, i.e., Suwannee Rivet Humic and
   Fulvic Acid Standards and Pony Lake Fulvic Acid Reference). We show that
   NOM interaction with the nanoparticle surface depends on (i) the NOM's
   chemical composition, where sulfur- and nitrogen-rich NOM more
   significantly increases colloidal stability, and (ii) the affinity of
   the capping agent for the AgNP surface, where nanoparticles with loosely
   bound capping agents are more effectively stabilized by NOM. Adsorption
   of NOM is shown to have little effect on AgNP dissolution under most
   experimental conditions, the exception being when the NOM is rich in
   sulfur and nitrogen. Similarly, the toxicity of AgNPs to a bacterial
   model (Shewanella oneidensis MR-1) decreases most significantly in the
   presence of sulfur- and nitrogen-rich NOM: Our data suggest that the
   rate of AgNP aggregation and dissolution in aquatic environments
   containing NOM will depend on the chemical composition of the NOM, and
   that the toxicity of AgNPs to aquatic microorganisms is controlled
   primarily by the extent of nanoparticle dissolution.

AB The characterization of nanomaterials represents a complex analytical

   (AUC) is especially useful for the characterization of small

   observed, either at low pH or very high ionic strength or hardness,
   demonstrating their high physicochemical stability (and thus high
   mobility in soils). Furthermore, natural organic matter had little
   effect On the hydrodynamic diameters of the allospheres. The
   concentration of the nanoparticles was an important parameter
   influencing their agglomeration results obtained using dynamic light
   scattering at high particle concentrations showed large agglomerate
   sizes and significant particle losses through sedimentation) clearly
   indicating the importance of characterizing the nanomaterials under

AB Ubiquitous natural organic matter (NOM) plays an important role in the
   aggregation state of engineered silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in aquatic
   environment, which determines the transport, transformation, and
   toxicity of AgNPs. As various capping agents are used as coatings for
   nanoparticles and NOM are natural polymer mixture with wide molecular
   weight (MW) distribution, probing the particle coating-dependent
   interaction of MW fractionated natural organic matter (M-f-NOM) with
   various coatings is helpful for understanding the differential
   aggregation and transport behavior of engineered AgNPs as well as other
   metal nanoparticles. In this study, we investigated the role of pristine
   and M-f-NOM on the aggregation of AgNPs with Bare, citrate, and PVP
   coating (Bare-, Cit-, and PVP-AgNP) in mono- and divalent electrolyte
   solutions. We observed that the enhanced aggregation or dispersion of
   AgNPs in NOM solution highly depends on the coating of AgNPs. Pristine
   NOM inhibited the aggregation of Bare-AgNPs but enhanced the aggregation
   of PVP-AgNPs. In addition, M-f-NOM fractions have distinguishing roles
   on the aggregation and dispersion of AgNPs, which also highly depend on
   the AgNPs coating as well as the MW of M-f-NOM. Higher MW M-f-NOM (>100
   kDa and 30-100 kDa) enhanced the aggregation of PVP-AgNPs in mono- and
   divalent electrolyte solutions, whereas lower MW M-f-NOM (10-30 kDa,
   3-10 kDa and <3 kDa) inhibited the aggregation of PVP-AgNPs. However,
   all the M-f-NOM fractions inhibited the aggregation of Bare-AgNPs. For
   PVP- and Bare-AgNPs, the stability of AgNPs in electrolyte solution was
   significantly correlated to the MW of M-f-NOM. But for Cit-AgNPs,
   pristine NOM and M-f-NOM has minor influence on the stability of AgNPs.
   These findings about significantly different roles of M-f-NOM on
   aggregation of engineered AgNPs with various coating are important for
   better understanding of the transport and subsequent transformation of
   AgNPs in aquatic environment.

AB Polysaccharide-based bioflocculants have attracted considerable
   attention in recent years due to their biodegradable, harmless and
   negligible secondary pollution. Bioflocculants are organic
   macromolecular substances secreted by microorganisms. A simple,
   cost-effective and green method was developed for the biosynthesis of
   silver nanoparticles using polysaccharides as reducing and stabilizing
   agents. In this paper, we report on the production and optimization of
   polysaccharide-based bioflocculant for the green synthesis of silver
   nanoparticles by Streptomyces sp. MBRC-91. Medium composition and
   culture conditions for polysaccharide-based bioflocculants were
   statistically optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). The
   bioflocculant production was statistically optimized with most
   significant factors, namely palm jaggery (18.73 g/L), yeast extract
   (2.07 g/L), K2HPO4 (3.74 g/L) and NaCl (0.38 g/L); respectively. The
   biosynthesized silver nanoparticles were characterized by UV-vis
   spectroscopy, XRD, FTIR, FESEM, EDXA and HRTEM. The biosynthesized
   silver nanoparticles revealed strong antibacterial activity in sewage
   water and this result could make a new avenue in the wastewater
   treatment. Therefore, the biosynthesized silver nanoparticles can be
   extended as an alternative for the development of new bactericidal
   bionanomaterials for wastewater treatment and biotechnological
   applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The sorption properties of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) on sand were
   investigated in the presence of Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) as a
   surrogate for natural organic matter. SRHA drastically reduced the
   sorption preference regardless of the initial pH and ionic strength of
   the solution. Despite the higher SRHA loading onto sand versus the TiO2
   NPs, the consequent zeta (zeta)-potential drop was more significant in
   the TiO2 NPs, indicating that the decreased sorption should be primarily
   ascribed to the fraction of SRHA sorbed onto the TiO2 NP surfaces. The
   hindering effect of SRHA on the sorption increased with SRHA
   concentration, but stabilized at the concentration equivalent to full
   surface coverage of the TiO2 NPs and sand in the reaction system.
   Interaction force measurements indicated that SRHA inhibits the approach
   of the TiO2 NPs to the sand surface, as expected by the
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek calculation. However, the adhesion
   force of TiO2 NPs to sand was not critically affected by the presence of
   SRHA. TiO2 NP sorption to natural sand was limited as to the
   acid-treated sand in the presence of SRHA, implying that the organics
   dissolved from natural sand might facilitate the transport of TiO2 NPs
   in aquifers by inhibiting TiO2 NP sorption to aquifer materials.

AB The presence of nanoparticles (NPs) in natural aquatic environment is a
   potential risk to aquatic and human life. Periphyton, ubiquitous in
   aquatic environment, has been used to remove pollutants from aquatic
   systems. Understanding the interaction between NPs and periphyton will
   help to better predict the behavior and fate of NPs in aquatic media.
   This study was aimed to investigate the CuO NP biosorption mechanism by
   periphyton at acidic, neutral, and alkaline pH and with varying natural
   organic matter (NOM) concentrations. The rate of adsorption and removal
   of CuO NPs was decreased with increase in initial pH and NOM
   concentration. The zeta potential study suggests that the biosorption of
   CuO NPs by periphyton was related to electrostatic force of attraction.
   The particle size distribution of CuO NPs in solution with different NOM
   concentrations played an important role in CuO NP removal. The well fit
   between pseudo-first-order kinetics and adsorption process indicated
   that physical sorption appears to be the dominating process. These
   results show that periphyton can be employed for an environmentally
   benign and effective solution for NP removal.

AB Colloidal stabilities of polymer-coated nanosized zero-valent iron
   (pNZVI) and bare nanosized zero-valent iron (bNZVI) particles were
   investigated in the presence of groundwater solutes, such as Suwannee
   River natural organic matter (SRNOM), Pony Lake fulvic acid (PLFA),
   sodium ion, and calcium ion. Measurements of hydrodynamic diameter and
   zeta-potential showed that dissolved organic matters (SRNOM and PLFA)
   enhanced the stability of bNZVI particles, but that they did not affect
   the stability of pNZVI particles. These measurements also showed that
   the stability of pNZVI particles was inhibited by the cations but that
   the effect of the cations on bNZVI particles was inconclusive. The
   sedimentation test confirmed that the stability of pNZVI particles was
   inhibited by the sodium and calcium ions. The sedimentation test
   identified that the stability of bNZVI particles was inhibited only in
   the presence of calcium ion. The predictions on the stability of NZVI
   particles based on the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek interaction
   energies were generally consistent with experimental observations.
   Energy barriers of bNZVI particles were estimated to be up to 7.5 and 91
   k(B)T in the presence of PLFA and SRNOM, respectively. For pNZVI
   particles, energy barriers were present in all experimental conditions
   except for the suspension with calcium ion.

AB Polymeric nanoparticles have been developed for several applications,
   among them as carrier system of pesticides. However, few studies have
   investigated the fate of these materials in the environment in relation
   to colloidal stability and toxicity. In nature, humic substances are the
   main agents responsible for complexation with metals and organic
   compounds, as well as responsible for the dynamics of these
   nanoparticles in aquatic and terrestrial environments. In this context,
   the evaluation of the influence of aquatic humic substances (AHS) on the
   colloidal stability and toxicity of polymeric nanoparticles of
   chitosan/tripolyphosphate with or without paraquat was performed. In
   this study, the nanoparticles were prepared by the ionic gelation method
   and characterized by size distribution measurements (DLS and NTA), zeta
   potential, infrared and fluorescence spectroscopy. Allium cepa
   genotoxicity studies and ecotoxicity assays with the alga
   Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata were used to investigate the effect of
   aquatic humic substances (AHS) on the toxicity of this delivery system.
   No changes were observed in the physical-chemical stability of the
   nanoparticles due to the presence of AHS using DLS and NTA techniques.
   However some evidence of interaction between the nanoparticles and AHS
   was observed by infrared and fluorescence spectroscopies. The
   ecotoxicity and genotoxicity assays showed that humic substances can
   decrease the toxic effects of nanoparticles containing paraquat. These
   results are interesting because they are important for understanding the
   interaction of these nanostructured carrier systems with species present
   in aquatic ecosystems such as humic substances, and in this way, opening
   new perspectives for studies on the dynamics of these carrier systems in
   the ecosystem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the fate and transport of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is
   of importance due to their widespread use and potential harmful effects
   on humans and the environment. The present study investigates the fate
   and transport of widely used Creighton AgNPs in saturated porous media.
   Previous investigations of AgNP transport in the presence of natural
   organic matter (NOM) report contradictory results regarding how the
   presence of NOM affected the stability and mobility of AgNPs. In this
   work, a nonreactive tracer, AgNPs and a mixture of AgNPs and NOM were
   injected into a background solution (0.01 mM of NaNO3) flowing through
   laboratory columns packed with water-saturated glass beads to obtain
   concentration versus time breakthrough curves. Transport of AgNPs in the
   presence of NOM was simulated with a model that accounted for both
   reversible and irreversible attachment. Based upon an analysis of the
   AgNP breakthrough curves, it was found that addition of NOM at
   concentrations ranging from 1 to 40 mg L-1 resulted in significant
   decreases in both the zeroth and first moments of the breakthrough
   curves. These observations may be attributed to NOM promoting AgNP
   aggregation and irreversible attachment. Raman and surface-enhanced
   Raman scattering analysis of NOM-AgNP mixtures revealed that a possible
   interaction of NOM with AgNP occurred through the carboxylic moieties
   (-COO-) located in the immediate vicinity of the metallic surface. At
   higher concentrations of NOM, both the zeroth and first moments of the
   breakthrough curves increased. Based on modeling and the literature, we
   hypothesize that as the NOM concentration increases, it begins to coat
   both the AgNPs and the glass beads, leading to a situation where AgNP
   transport may be described in the same way that transport of a sorbing
   hydrophobic compound partitioning to an immobile organic phase is
   typically described, assuming reversible, rate-limited sorption.

   organic molecules structurally related to catechol that facilitate a
   chemical enhancement of the Raman signal. Here, we report that magnetite
   (Fe3O4) nanoparticles provide a SERS signal from oxalic acid and
   cysteine via an electric field enhancement Magnetite thus likely
   provides an oxide substrate for SERS study of any adsorbed organic
   molecule. This substrate combines benefits from both metal-based and
   chemical SERS by providing an oxide surface for studies of
   environmentally and catalytically relevant detailed chemical bonding
   information with fewer restrictions of molecular structure or binding
   mechanisms. Therefore, the magnetite-based SERS demonstrated here
   provides a new approach to establishing the surface interactions of
   environmentally relevant organic ligands and mineral surfaces.

AB Adsorption of natural organic matter, aggregation and disaggregation
   have been identified as three of the main processes affecting the fate
   and behaviour of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) in aquatic
   environments. However, although several methods have been developed to
   study the aggregation behaviour of ENPs in natural waters, there are
   only a few studies focusing on the fate of such aggregates and their
   potential disaggregation behaviour. In this study, we proposed and
   demonstrated a simple method for characterising the aggregation
   behaviour and aggregate structure of ENPs in different natural waters.
   Both the aggregate size of ENPs and their adsorption capacity for
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) were strongly related (R-2 > 0.97, p <
   .05) to the combined effect of initial concentration of dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) and the ionic strength of the natural waters. The
   structure of the formed aggregates was strongly correlated (R-2 > 0.95,
   p < .05) to the amount of DOM adsorbed by the ENPs during the
   aggregation process. Under high ionic strength conditions, aggregation
   is mainly governed by diffusion and the aggregates formed under these
   conditions showed the lowest stability and fractal dimension, forming
   linear, chain-like aggregates. In contrast, under low ionic strength
   conditions, the aggregate structure was more compact, most likely due to
   strong chemical binding with DOM and bridging mechanisms involving
   divalent cations formed during reaction-limited aggregation. (C) 2014

AB The present study investigated changes in suspension stability and

   River natural organic matter and aging of stock and test suspensions
   prior to testing. Acute toxicity tests of silver (Ag), zinc oxide (ZnO),
   and titanium dioxide (TiO2) ENPs with Daphnia magna were carried out
   following Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development test
   guidelines. Daphnia magna was found to be very sensitive to Ag ENPs
   (48-h 50% effective concentration 33gL(-1)), and aging of the test
   suspensions in M7 medium (up to 48h) did not decrease toxicity
   significantly. Conversely, the presence of Suwannee River natural
   organic matter (NOM; 20mgL(-1)) completely alleviated Ag ENP toxicity in
   all testing scenarios and did not aid in stabilizing suspensions. In
   contrast, addition of Suwannee River NOM stabilized ZnO ENP suspensions
   and did not decrease toxicity. Aging for 48h generated monotonous
   concentration-response curves in the presence and absence of Suwannee
   River NOM. At concentrations up to 100mgL(-1) TiO2 ENPs did not cause
   immobilization of D. magna under any of the tested conditions. Presence
   of Suwannee River NOM caused agglomeration in stock suspensions. The
   authors' results suggest that aging and presence of Suwannee River NOM
   are important parameters in standard toxicity testing of ENPs, which in
   some cases may aid in gaining better control over the exposure
   conditions but in other cases might contribute to agglomeration or
   elimination of ENP toxicity. Therefore, modifications to the current
   guidelines for testing ENPs should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

AB Chromate was used as a chemical probe to investigate the size-dependent
   influence of organics on nanoparticle surface reactivity.
   Magnetitechromate sorption experiments were conducted with similar to 90
   and similar to 6 nm magnetite nanoparticles in the presence and absence
   of fulvic acid (FA), natural organic matter (NOM), and isolated landfill
   leachate (LL). Results indicated that low concentrations (1 mg/L) of
   organics had no noticeable impact on chromate sorption, whereas
   concentrations of 50 mg/L or more resulted in decreased amounts of
   chromate sorption. The adsorption of organics onto the magnetite
   surfaces interfered equally with the ability of the 6 and 90 nm
   particles to sorb chromate from solution, despite the greater surface
   area of the smaller particles. Results indicate the presence of organics
   did not impact the redox chemistry of the magnetite-chromate system over
   the duration of the experiments (8 h), nor did the organics interact
   with the chromate in solution. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) results indicate that the organics blocked the
   surface reactivity by occupying surface sites on the particles. The
   similarity of results with FA and NOM suggests that coverage of the
   reactive mineral surface is the main factor behind the inhibition of
   surface reactivity in the presence of organics.

AB Engineered nanoparticles (NPs) released into natural environments will
   interact with natural organic matter (NOM) or humic substances, which
   will change their fate and transport behavior. Quantitative predictions
   of the effects of NOM are difficult because of its heterogeneity and
   variability. Here, the effects of six types of NOM and molecular weight
   fractions of each on the aggregation of citrate-stabilized gold NPs are
   investigated. Correlations of NP aggregation rates with electrophoretic
   mobility and the molecular weight distribution and chemical attributes
   of NOM (including UV absorptivity or aromaticity, functional group
   content, and fluorescence) are assessed. In general, the >100 kg/mol
   components provide better stability than lower molecular weight
   components for each type of NOM, and they contribute to the stabilizing
   effect of the unfractionated NOM even in small proportions. In many
   cases, unfractionated NOM provided better stability than its separated
   components, indicating a synergistic effect between the high and low
   molecular weight fractions for NP stabilization. Weight-averaged
   molecular weight was the best single explanatory variable for NP
   aggregation rates across all NOM types and molecular weight fractions.
   NP aggregation showed poorer correlation with UV absorptivity, but the
   exponential slope of the UV-vis absorbance spectrum was a better
   surrogate for molecular weight. Functional group data (including reduced
   sulfur and total nitrogen content) were explored as possible secondary
   parameters to explain the strong stabilizing effect of a low molecular
   weight Pony Lake fulvic acid sample to the gold NPs. These results can
   inform future correlations and measurement requirements to predict NP
   attachment in the presence of NOM.

   (CeO2) nanoparticles (PAA-CeO2) was evaluated for its stability in a
   range of freshwater ecotoxicity media (MHRW, TG 201 and M7), with and
   without natural organic matter (NOM). In a 15 day dispersion stability
   study, FAA-CeO2 did not undergo significant aggregation in any media
   type. Zeta potential varied between media types and was influenced by
   FAA-CeO2 concentration, but remained constant over 15 days. NOM had no
   influence on PAA-CeO2 aggregation or zeta potential. The ecotoxicity of
   the FAA-CeO2 dispersion was investigated in 72 h algal growth inhibition
   tests using the freshwater microalgae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata.
   PAA-CeO2 EC50 values for growth inhibition (GI; 0.024 mg/L) were 2-3
   orders of magnitude lower than pristine CeO2 EC50 values reported in the
   literature. The concentration of dissolved cerium (Ce3+/Ce4+) in
   PAA-CeO2 exposure suspensions was very low, ranging between 0.5 and 5.6
   mu g/L. Free PM concentration in the exposure solutions (0.0096-0.0384
   mg/L) was significantly lower than the EC10, growth inhibition (47.7
   mg/L) value of pure PAA, indicating that free PM did not contribute to
   the observed toxicity. Elemental analysis indicated that up to 38% of
   the total Cerium becomes directly associated with the algal cells during
   the 72 h exposure. TOP-SIMS analysis of algal cell wall compounds
   indicated three different modes of action, including a significant
   oxidative stress response to FAA-CeO2 exposure. In contrast to pristine
   CeO2 nanoparticles, which rapidly aggregate in standard ecotoxicity
   media, PAA-stabilised CeO2 nanoparticles remain dispersed and available
   to water column species. Interaction of PM with cell wall components,
   which could be responsible for the observed biomarker alterations, could
   not be excluded. This study indicates that the increased dispersion
   stability of FAA-CeO2 leads to an increase in toxicity compared to
   pristine non-stabilised forms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB In this study, humic acids (HAs) from three sources, peat, sediment and
   straw, used to coat nano-TiO2 were investigated. The results indicated
   that HAs isolated from peat were aromatic-rich, whereas those isolated
   from sediment and straw were aliphatic-rich. The nano-TiO2 sedimentation
   experiments indicated that the presence of aromatic-rich HAs was more
   capable of stabilizing nano-TiO2 particles than was the presence of
   aliphatic-rich HAs. This result is because the deionized phenolic groups
   in the HAs were preferentially adsorbed on the nano-TiO2 surfaces, which
   generated a higher charge density on the nano-TiO2 surfaces and caused
   stronger repulsive forces among particles. Furthermore, the
   aromatic-rich TiO2-HA complexes exhibited a greater sorption capacity
   than the aliphatic-rich TiO2-HAs complexes and nonlinear phenanthrene
   sorption because of their higher affinity and the condensed state of
   aromatic fractions. Note that natural organic matters, such as humic
   acids, in aquatic environments can not only increase the stability of
   nanoparticles but can also influence the mobility of hydrophobic organic
   compounds (HOCs). (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The ever-increasing daily use of engineered nanoparticles will lead to
   heightened levels of these materials in the environment. These
   nanomaterials will eventually go into the wastewater treatment plant
   (WWTP), therefore, resulting into a pressing need for information on
   their aggregation behavior and kinetics in the wastewater aqueous
   matrix. In this work, we dispersed two different metal oxide
   nanoparticles (ZnO and TiO2) into the influent of two different WWTPs.
   Through the time-resolved dynamic light scattering analysis and
   transmission electron microscopy, the metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs)
   were quite stably existed in the wastewater matrix with aggregates of
   diameter 300-400 nm after 4.5 h or more suspension. We confirmed that
   the dissolved organic matters (DOMs) attributed to the stability of
   nanoparticles. No propensity of NPs to aggregate were observed in the
   presence of both monovalent and divalent electrolytes even at high
   concentrations up to 0.15 M in NaCl or 0.025 M in CaCl2, indicating that
   the destabilization of nanoparticles in the complicated wastewater
   matrix was not achieved by the compression of electrical double layer,
   therefore, their aggregation kinetics cannot be simply predicted by the
   classic Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory of colloidal stability.
   However, obvious aggregation of nanoparticles in the Al-2(SO4)(3)
   solution system was observed with the likely mechanism of bridging of
   the metal oxide nanoparticles and aggregates due to the formation of
   hydrous alumina (Al(OH)(3)center dot H2O) in the Al-2(SO4)(3) solution.
   In the wastewater matrix, we used the noninvasive measurement technology
   to detect the O-2 flux of activated sludge before and after treatment
   with 1, 10 and 100 mg L-1 NPs. The results confirmed that both ZnO and
   TiO2 NPs showed an adverse impact on the O-2 uptake of activated sludge
   when the exposure time extended to 4.5 h. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) with biocompatible coatings are good
   candidates for MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) contrasting, magnetic
   hyperthermia treatments, and drug delivery systems. The spontaneous
   surface induced polymerization of dissolved organic matter on
   environmental mineral particles inspired us to prepare carboxylated
   core-shell MNPs by using a ubiquitous polyphenolic precursor. Through
   the adsorption and in situ surface polymerization of gallic acid (GA), a
   polygallate (PGA) coating is formed on the nanoparticles (PGA@MNP) with
   possible antioxidant capacity. The present work explores the mechanism
   of polymerization with the help of potentiometric acid-base titration,
   dynamic light scattering (for particle size and zeta potential
   determination), UV-vis (UV-visible light spectroscopy), FTIR-ATR
   (Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy by attenuated total
   reflection), and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) techniques. We
   observed the formation of ester and ether linkages between gallate
   monomers both in solution and in the adsorbed state. Higher polymers
   were formed in the course of several weeks both on the surface of
   nanoparticles and in the dispersion medium. The ratio of the absorbances
   of PGA supernatants at 400 and 600 nm (i.e., the E4/E6 ratio commonly
   used to characterize the degree of polymerization of humic materials)
   was determined to be 4.3, similar to that of humic acids. Combined XPS,
   dynamic light scattering, and FTIR-ATR results revealed that, prior to
   polymerization, the GA monomers became oxidized to poly(carboxylic
   acid)s due to ring opening while Fe3+ ions reduced to Fe2+. Our
   published results on the colloidal and chemical stability of PGA@MNPs
   are referenced thoroughly in the present work. Detailed studies on
   biocompatibility, antioxidant property, and biomedical applicability of
   the particles will be published.

AB Bovine serum albumin (BSA) coated on citrate capped gold nanoparticles
   (BSA-GNPs) was exposed to a simulated wastewater effluent (SSE) in order
   to study the mineralization and thereby mimic scaling at biofouled
   membranes of reverse osmosis (RO) wastewater desalination plants. RO is
   a leading technology of achieving freshwater quality as it has the
   capability of removing both dissolved inorganic salts and organic
   contaminants from tertiary wastewater effluents. The aim was to better
   understand one of the major problems facing this technology which is
   fouling of the membranes, mainly biofouling and scaling by calcium
   phosphate. The experiments were performed using the small-angle neutron
   scattering (SANS) technique. The nanoparticles, GNPs, stabilized by the
   citrate groups showed 30 angstrom large particles having a homogeneous
   distribution of gold and citrate with a gold volume fraction of the
   order of 1%. On the average two BSA monomers are grafted at 2.4 GNPs.
   The exposed BSA-GNPs to SSE solution led to immediate mineralization of
   stable composite particles of the order of 0.2 mu m diameter and a
   mineral volume fraction between 50% and 80%. The volume fraction of the
   mineral was of the order of 10(-5), which is roughly 3 times larger but
   an order of magnitude smaller than the maximum possible contents of
   respectively calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate in the SSE
   solution. Considering the extreme low solubility product of calcium
   phosphate, we suggest total calcium phosphate and partially (5-10%)
   calcium carbonate formation in the presence of BSA-GNPs.

AB Natural organic matter (NOM) sorption to nanoparticles (NPs) can
   influence their transport and bioavailability in the aquatic
   environment. The sorption affinity of NOM to surfaces including NPs is
   size dependent, and depending on environmental conditions, NOM may
   enhance or mitigate NPs toxicity. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the preferential sorption of different-sized fractions of
   NOM to titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs. We specifically investigated the
   influence of pH, ionic strength, and NOM concentration on the extent of
   this preferential sorption using a constant sorbent concentration (400
   mg/L TiO2 NPs). Additionally, sorption of NOM to TiO2 NPs at varying pH
   was investigated. The nonsorbed NOM was separated from the sorbed, by 50
   nm polycarbonate membrane filters and ultracentrifugation.
   High-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was used to
   determine the average molecular weights of NOM (MWw). Corroborative
   evidence of preferential sorption of different-sized molecular weight
   fractions of NOM was obtained from optical techniques such as absorbance
   and fluorescence spectrophotometry. The total organic carbon was
   measured by the Total Organic Carbon Analyzer-Shimadzu (TOC-VCPH). The
   results indicated that there is preferential sorption of larger sized
   fractions of NOM to TiO2 NPs irrespective of NOM concentration. It was
   observed that the sorption of larger sized fractions of NOM was much
   enhanced at lower pH and at higher ionic strength. Both absorbance and
   fluorescence spectrophotometric techniques gave credible corroborative
   evidence on the extent of preferential sorption of lager sized fractions
   of NOM with respect to pH and ionic strength. The sorption results
   demonstrated higher sorption at lower pH than at higher pH. Overall, the
   results of this study suggest that the environmental conditions are key
   factors that can contribute to NOM's fractional preferential sorption to
   NPs in the aquatic environment.

AB The objective of this study was to compare the relative impact of humic
   and non-humic natural organic matter (NOM) on the aggregation behaviors
   of engineered TiO2 nanoparticles (nano-TiO2). After exposure of
   nano-TiO2 to varying concentrations of Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA)
   and Bacillus subtilis exudate in high and low ionic strength (IS)
   solutions at pH 3 to pH 7.5, aggregation behaviors were evaluated via
   dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements and sedimentation studies.
   Although pH, IS, and NOM concentration exerted strong controls on
   nano-TiO2 aggregation behaviors, suspensions exposed to either SRFA or
   bacterial exudate at normalized dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   concentrations exhibited remarkably similar behaviors. In high IS
   systems, nano-TiO2 exposed to either SRFA or bacterial exudate
   sedimented rapidly, except in the presence of high NOMconcentrations at
   pH 6 and 7.5. Low IS treatments exhibited a larger range of effects. In
   fact, relative to NOM-free controls, nano-TiO2 aggregates in SRFA and
   bacterial exudate exposures sedimented up to 14 times faster at pH 3 and
   up to 13 times slower at pH 7.5. Adsorption of organic molecules onto
   nano-TiO2 can enhance aggregation via colloidal bridging and/or charge
   neutralization, or with more complete surface coverage, can diminish
   aggregation via electrostatic repulsion and/or steric hindrance.
   Collectively, these data suggest that solution pH, IS, and NOM
   concentration, and to a lesser extent NOM origin, can control the fate
   and mobility of nano-TiO2 in geologic systems.

AB Information on the effects of water temperature, among several
   environmental factors, on predicting the behavior, fate, and exposure
   risks of engineered nanoparticles (NPs), is scarce. In the present work,
   the behavior and fate of commercial zinc oxide (ZnO) NPs with an average
   diameter of 52 nm were extensively investigated in U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency standard, synthetic freshwater media with varying pH
   and hardness containing 2 mg C/L of humic acid as a natural organic
   matter (NOM) surrogate, in the temperature range from 4 degrees C to 45
   degrees C, representing very cold to warm waters. While a constant
   increase of ZnO hydrodynamic diameter was observed with increasing the
   temperature, results of analysis of variance showed that the temperature
   effect was insignificant in the samples with enhanced ionic strength,
   and water chemistry had more pronounced effects than the temperature on
   the rate of ZnO NP aggregation. With increase of the water temperature,
   the NP surface charge was partially reduced. ZnO NP dissolution and
   surface adsorption of NOM and zinc ions were found to be exothermic
   processes, and the latter was significantly decreased when temperature
   was increased in all test matrices. This study provides useful
   information for assessing environmental risks of ZnO NPs in aqueous
   matrices with various water chemistries and temperatures. (C) 2014

AB The elucidation of the interaction between TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) and

   fates, features, and environmental impacts of NPs. In this work,
   two-dimensional (2D) Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) correlation
   spectroscopy (CoS) assisted by the fluorescence excitation-emission
   matrix (EEM) method is used to explore the interaction mechanism of
   humic acid (HA) with TiO2 NPs at a molecular level. The results show
   that the C-O bonds (carboxylate, amide, quinone, or ketone) and C-O
   bonds (phenol, aliphatic C-OH, and polysaccharide) of HA play important
   roles in their interaction with TiO2 NPs. The adsorption process of HA
   onto the surface of TiO2 NPs is different from the bonding process of
   the two species in solution. The forms of the relevant groups of HA and
   their consequent reaction with TiO2 NPs are affected to a great extent
   by the solution pH and the surface charge of NPs. The 2D-FTIR-CoS method
   is found to be able to construct a comprehensive picture about the
   NOM-TiO2 NPs interaction process. This 2D-FTIR-CoS approach might also
   be used to probe other complicated interaction processes in natural and

AB Nano-silver is increasingly used in consumer products from washing
   machines and refrigerators to devices marketed for the disinfection of
   drinking water or recreational water. The nano-silver in these products
   may be released, ending up in surface water bodies which may be used as
   drinking water sources. Little information is available about the
   stability of the nano-silver in sources of drinking water, its fate
   during drinking water disinfection processes, and its interaction with
   disinfection agents and disinfection by-products (DBPs). This study aims
   to investigate the stability of nano-silver in drinking water sources
   and in the finished drinking water when chlorine and chloramines are
   used for disinfection and to observe changes in the composition of DBPs
   formed when nano-silver is present in the source water. A dispersion of
   nano-silver particles (10 nm; PVP-coated) was used to spike untreated
   Ottawa River water, treated Ottawa River water, organic-free water, and
   a groundwater at concentrations of 5 mg/L. The diluted dispersions were
   kept under stirred and non-stirred conditions for up to 9 months and
   analyzed weekly using UV absorption to assess the stability of the
   nano-silver particles. In a separate experiment, Ottawa River water
   containing nano-silver particles (at 0.1 and 1 mg/L concentration,
   respectively) was disinfected by adding sodium hypochlorite (a
   chlorinating agent) in sufficient amounts to maintain a free chlorine
   residual of approximately 0.4 mg/L after 24 h. The disinfected drinking
   water was then quenched with ascorbic acid and analyzed for 34 neutral
   DBPs (trihalomethanes, haloacetonitriles, haloacetaldehydes, 1,1
   dichloro-2-propanone, 1,1,1 trichloro-2-propanone, chloropicrin, and
   cyanogen chloride). The results were compared to the profile of DBPs
   obtained under the same conditions in the absence of nano-silver and in
   the presence of an equivalent concentration of Ag+ ions (as AgNO3). The
   stability of the nano-silver dispersions in untreated Ottawa River
   water, with a dissolved organic carbon concentration of 6 mg/L, was
   significantly higher than the stability of the nano-silver dispersions
   in distilled, organic-free water. Nano-silver particles suspended in the
   groundwater agglomerated and were quickly and quantitatively removed
   from the solution. Our data confirm previous observations that natural
   dissolved organic matter stabilizes nano-silver particles, while the
   high-ionic strength of groundwater appears to favor their agglomeration
   and precipitation. As expected, nano-silver was not stable in Ottawa
   River water through the chlorination process, but survived for many days
   when added to the Ottawa River water after treatment with chlorine or
   chloramines. Stirring appeared to have minimal effect on nano-silver
   stability in untreated and treated Ottawa River water. The profile of
   DBPs formed in the presence of nAg differed significantly from the
   profile of DBPs formed in the absence of nAg only at the 1 mg/L nAg
   concentration. The differences observed consisted mainly in reduced
   formation of some brominated DBPs and a small increase in the formation
   of cyanogen chloride. The reduced formation of brominated congeners may
   be explained by the decrease in available bromide due to the presence of
   Ag+ ions.
   It should be noted that a concentration of 1 mg/L is significantly
   higher than nAg concentrations that would be expected to be present in
   surface waters, but these results could be significant for the
   disinfection of some wastewaters with comparably high nano-silver
   concentrations.

AB Photoinduced reduction of silver ion (Ag+) to silver nanoparticles
   (AgNPs) by dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a crucial role in the
   transformation and transport of engineered AgNPs and Ag+ in aquatic
   environments. DOM is a mixture of natural polymers with wide molecular
   weight (MW) distribution, and the roles of specific components of DOM in
   the photoreduction of Ag+ to AgNPs are still not understood. In this
   study, MW fractionated natural organic matter (M-f-NOM) were
   investigated for their roles on the photoreduction process and
   stabilization of the formed AgNPs. This photoinduced reduction process
   depends highly on pH, concentration of Ag+ and NOM, light quality, and
   the MW of M-f-NOM. Monochromatic radiation and light attenuation
   correction suggested that the difference of M-f-NOM on reduction was
   mainly ascribed to the differential light attenuation of M-f-NOM rather
   than the "real" reductive ability. More importantly, compared with low
   MW fractions, the high MW M-f-NOMs exhibit drastically higher capability
   in stabilizing the photosynthesized AgNPs against Ca2+-induced
   aggregation. This finding is important for a better understanding of the
   differential roles of M-f-NOM in the transformation and transport of Ag+
   and engineered AgNPs in DOM-rich surface water.

   work, we demonstrate that in the presence of combinations of water
   components the transformation of ionic Ag to "new'' AgNPs occurs via
   heterogeneous nucleation followed by (1) light-induced growth mediated
   by surface plasmon resonance activity of AgNPs, and (2) Ostwald ripening
   in the absence of light and chloride anions. Further, oxidative
   dissolution of AgNPs at near-neutral pH (6.8) releases Ag ions, which
   either complex with the components or form "new'' AgNPs depending on
   solution chemistry. AgNP nucleation and growth on bacterial cells (e.
   g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa) may cause cell lysis. This study highlights
   that light-illuminated waters comprising common aquatic components are
   highly favorable for the AgNP formation over dissolution under neutral
   pH conditions, in which the presence of chloride accelerates AgNP
   formation and the reducing capacity of EPS/chloride medium may be
   greater than NOM (humics and fulvics). Findings of this study suggest
   that AgNP formation and dissolution may be a continual process and AgNPs
   thus formed may be stabilized by organic matter, which possibly leads to
   persistence of the nanoparticles in sunlit waters.

AB Mercuric sulfide species are likely the predominant forms of mercury

   Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is known to affect the formation,

   these processes to Hg bioavailability is not well understood. The
   objectives of this study were to gain insights into the molecular
   structure and aggregation properties of nanoscale HgS particles that
   were formed and aged in the presence of DOM and to link this information
   to bioavailability for methylating bacteria. Characterization of
   nanoscale HgS was performed with a series of techniques including
   transmission electron microscopy, photon scattering, X-ray diffraction,
   and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The characterization results
   indicated that the HgS precipitates formed were metacinnabar-like
   spherical nanoparticles that were 3-5 nm in diameter. Over the course of
   the aging process, HgS nanoparticles (nano-HgS) agglomerated to form
   mass-fractal aggregates, although the size of each primary particle
   within the aggregates remained unchanged. Furthermore, the crystallinity
   of nano-HgS increased as the particles aged. The methylation potential
   of nano-HgS by sulfate-reducing bacteria decreased during the aging
   process. No clear correlation was observed between the net productions
   of MeHg and the concentrations of dissolved Hg(II) in the culture media,
   suggesting that the decrease in the methylation potential of aged
   nano-HgS was not simply because of the slower supply of dissolved Hg(II)
   by nano-HgS. While the link between the aging of nano-HgS and decrease
   of methylation potential is not fully understood, the results of our
   study indicate that freshly formed HgS particles in DOM-rich water will
   include a variety of nanoscale structures that have a wide range of
   methylation potentials. This knowledge provides a basis for better
   prediction of mercury bioavailability and MeHg production in

AB The behavior and fate of nanoparticles (NPs) in the marine environment
   are largely unknown and potentially have important environmental and
   human health implications. The aggregation and fate of NPs in the marine
   environment are greatly influenced by their interactions with seawater
   and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In the present study, the stability
   and aggregation of 30-nm-diameter silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) capped
   with citrate and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP; AgNP-citrate and AgNP-PVP)
   and 21-nm-diameter titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs as affected by seawater
   salinity and DOC were investigated by measuring hydrodynamic diameters
   and zeta potentials. The added DOC (in humic acid form) stabilized the 3
   types of NPs when the seawater salinities were 5 parts per thousand
   (ppt), but the stabilizing effect of DOC was reduced by a higher
   salinity (e.g., 30 ppt). In addition, AgNP-PVP was more stable than
   AgNP-citrate in seawater, indicating that surface capping agents and
   stabilization mechanisms govern the stability and aggregation of NPs.
   Statistical analysis showed that salinity is the most dominant influence
   on the stability and aggregation of AgNPs and TiO(2)NPs, followed by
   DOC. These findings expand our knowledge on the behavior of AgNPs and
   TiO(2)NPs in seawater and indicate that the fate of these NPs will be
   primarily to aggregate in the water column, precipitate, and accumulate
   in sediments following release into the marine environment. Environ

AB One major concern in the fate of nanomaterials in aquatic systems is the
   lack of data on nanomaterial transformations under relevant
   environmental conditions. The disagglomeration of aggregates composed of
   manufactured anatase titanium dioxide nanoparticles is investigated here
   in the presence of alginate and Suwannee River humic acids at varying
   concentrations using dynamic light scattering and electrophoretic
   measurements. Stability of TiO2 nanoparticle agglomerates at typical
   environmental concentrations of natural organic matter is discussed at a
   pH value corresponding to the point of zero charge of TiO2
   nanoparticles. In this scenario, the surface charge of TiO2 is
   neutralized, allowing the nanoparticles to form large agglomerates.
   Alginate and Suwannee River humic acids exhibit a negative structural
   charge under this pH condition and adsorption of both natural
   polyelectrolytes on the surface of nanoparticle agglomerates leads to
   disagglomeration and significant redispersion of TiO2 nanoparticles into
   fragments. Results indicate that both electrostatic forces and steric
   interactions play key roles during the disagglomeration process and that
   the physicochemical properties of natural organic matter are found to
   influence the kinetics and importance of fragmentation in the
   disagglomeration process. Most importantly, our data indicate that the
   presence of natural organic matter at typical environmental
   concentrations induces significant disagglomeration of large submicron
   nanoparticle agglomerates. Such a result constitutes an important
   outcome with regards to the risk associated with manufactured
   nanoparticles by including the possible transformations of the micron
   size range structures they can form.

AB Iron sulfide (FeS) nanoparticles were prepared with sodium carboxymethyl
   cellulose (CMC) as a stabilizer, and tested for enhanced removal of
   aqueous mercury (Hg2+). CMC at >= 0.03 wt % fully stabilized 0.5 g/L of
   FeS (i.e., CMC-to-FeS molar ratio >= 0.0006). FTIR spectra suggested
   that CMC molecules were attached to the nanoparticles through bidentate
   bridging and hydrogen bonding. Increasing the CMC-to-FeS molar ratio
   from 0 to 0.0006 enhanced mercury sorption capacity by 20%; yet,
   increasing the ratio from 0.0010 to 0.0025 diminished the sorption by
   14%. FTIR and XRD analyses suggested that precipitation (formation of
   cinnabar and metacinnabar), ion exchange (formation of Hg0.89Fe0.11S),
   and surface complexation were important mechanisms for mercury removal.
   A pseudo-second-order kinetic model was able to interpret the sorption
   kinetics, whereas a dual-mode isotherm model was proposed to simulate
   the isotherms, which considers precipitation and adsorption. High
   mercury uptake was observed over the pH range of 6.5-10.5, whereas
   significant capacity loss was observed at pH < 6. High concentrations of
   Cl- (>106 mg/L) and organic matter (5 mg/L as TOC) modestly inhibited
   mercury uptake. The immobilized mercury remained stable when preserved
   for 2.5 years at pH above neutral.

AB This work reports the role of iron redox pair (Fe3+/Fe2+) in the
   formation of naturally occurring silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the
   aquatic environment. The results showed that Fe3+ or Fe2+ ions in the
   mixtures of Ag+ and natural organic matter enhanced the formation of
   AgNPs. The formation of AgNPs depended on pH and types of organic
   matter. Increase in pH enhanced the formation of AgNPs, and humic acids
   as ligands showed higher formation of AgNPs compared to fulvic acids.
   The observed results were described by considering the potentials of
   redox pairs of silver and iron species and the possible species involved
   in reducing silver ions to AgNPs. Dynamic light scattering and
   transmission electron microscopy measurements of AgNPs revealed mostly
   bimodal size distribution with decrease in size of AgNPs due to iron
   species in the reaction mixture. Minimum inhibitory concentration of
   AgNPs needed to inhibit the growth of various bacterial species
   suggested the role of surfaces of tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative
   bacteria. Stability study of AgNPs, formed in Ag+-humic acid/fulvic
   acids-Fe3+ mixtures over a period of several months showed high
   stability of the particles with significant increase in surface plasmon
   resonance peak. The environmental implications of the results in terms
   of fate, transport, and ecotoxicity of organic-coated AgNPs are briefly
   presented.

AB Naturally occurring Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been widely observed
   in ore deposits, coal, soil, and environmental water. Identifying the
   source of these naturally occurring AuNPs could be helpful for not only
   the discovery of Au deposits through advanced exploration methods, but
   also the elucidation of the biogeochemical cycle and environmental
   toxicity of ionic Au and engineered AuNPs. Here, we investigated the
   effect of natural/simulated sunlight and heating on the reduction of
   ionic Au by ubiquitous dissolved organic matter (DOM) in river water.
   The reductive process probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   revealed that phenolic, alcoholic, and aldehyde groups in DOM act as
   reductive sites. Long-time exposure with thermal and photoirradiation
   induced the further fusion and growth of AuNPs to branched Au
   nanostructure as precipitation. The formation processes and kinetics of
   AuNPs were Further investigated using humic acid (HA) as the DOM model,
   with comprehensive characterizing methods. We have observed that HA can
   reduce ionic Au(III) complex (as chloride or hydroxyl complex) to
   elemental Au nanoparticles under sunlight or heating. In this process,
   nearly all of the Au(III) could be reduced to AuNPs, in which HA serves
   as not only the reductive agent, but also the coating agent to stabilize
   and disperse AuNPs. The size and stability of AuNPs were highly
   dependent on the concentration ratio of Au(III) to HA. These results
   imply that, besides biological processes, this thermal or photochemical
   reduction process is another possible source of naturally occurring
   AuNPs in natural environments, which possibly has critical impacts on
   the transport and transformation of Au and engineered AuNPs.

AB The cloud point extraction (CPE) of commercial copper(II) oxide
   nanoparticles (CuO NPs, mean diameter of 28 nm) in water samples was
   fully investigated. Factors such as Triton X-114 (TX-114) concentration,
   pH, incubation temperature and time, were optimized. The effects of CuO
   NP behavior like agglomeration, dissolution, and surface adsorption of
   natural organic matter, Cu2+, and coating chemicals, on its recovery
   were studied. The results indicated that all the CPE factors had
   significant effects on the extraction efficiency. An enrichment factor
   of similar to 89 was obtained under optimum CPE conditions. The
   hydrodynamic diameter of CuO NPs increased to 4-5 mu m upon
   agglomeration of NP-micelle assemblies, and decreased at pH >10.0 at
   which the extraction efficiency was also lowered. The solubility and
   therefore, the loss of NPs were greatly enhanced at pH <8.5 and in the
   first 60 min of incubation, whereas it declined at elevated incubation
   temperatures. Our results showed that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   >5 mg C L-1 and Cu2+ >2 times that of CuO NPs, lowered and enhanced the
   extraction efficiency, respectively. Pretreatment of samples with 3%
   wv(-1) of hydrogen peroxide and 10 mM of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
   minimized the interferences posed by DOC and Cu2+, respectively. The
   decrease in CPE efficiency was also evident for ligands like
   poly(ethylene glycol). The TX-114-rich phase could be determined with
   either inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry following microwave
   digestion, or graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The
   detection limits for CuO NPs were 0.02 and 0.06 mu g L-1 using these
   techniques, respectively. The optimum sample pre-treatment and CPE
   conditions were successfully applied to the river and wastewater
   samples. The relative recoveries of CuO NPs spiked at 5-100 mu g L-1 (as
   Cu) in these samples were in the range of between 59.2 and 108.2%. The
   approach demonstrates a robust analytical method for detecting trace
   levels of CuO NPs at their original states and assessing their exposure
   risks in real aquatic environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB In many studies, different humic acid (HA) sources are used
   interchangeably to evaluate the effect of organic matter on geochemical
   processes in the environment. This research looks more specifically at
   the effect of HA source on HA adsorption onto nano-TiO2 and how HA
   adsorption affects the fate and transport of nano-TiO2. In this study,
   six humic acids (HAs) were studied which were derived from soils (SLHA),
   or from sediments (SDHA) all originating from the state of Florida.
   Humic acid adsorption onto titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-TiO2)
   and the sedimentation of HA-coated and uncoated nano-TiO2 were monitored
   by Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. Synchronous scan
   fluorescence (SSF) spectroscopy was used to complement the study of HA
   adsorption onto nano-TiO2. Phosphate buffer was found to reduce the
   amount of HA adsorbed onto nano-TiO2 relative to solutions of NaCl of
   the same pH and ionic strength. Adsorption constant values (K-ads) for
   HAs varied in the order SLHA > FSDHA (freshwater sedimentary HA) > ESDHA
   (estuarine sedimentary HA). SSF results suggested that the more highly
   conjugated fractions of HA, which are more prevalent in SLHAs versus
   SDHAs, were preferentially adsorbed. In order to better understand the
   relationship between adsorption and aggregation, sedimentation studies
   were conducted and it was found that the percentage of nano-TiO2
   sedimentation was preferentially enhanced in the order of the presence
   of SLHA > FSDHA > ESDHA. The extent of nano-TiO2 sedimentation was
   decreased with increasing HA concentration. TEM imaging of nano-TiO2
   confirmed that nano-TiO2 was aggregated in the presence of HAs. The
   findings in this study suggest that HAs from different sources influence
   the fate and transport of nano-TiO2 in the environment differently. (c)

AB The surface charge and average size of manufactured ZnO nanoparticles
   (NPs) were studied as a function of pH to understand the aggregation
   behavior and importance of the electrostatic interactions in solution.
   The interactions between ZnO and Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) were
   then investigated under a range of environmentally relevant conditions
   with the ZnO nanoparticles pH(pzc) as the point of reference. The
   anionic charges carried by aquatic humic substances were found to play a
   major role in the aggregation and disaggregation of ZnO nanoparticles.
   At low concentrations of SRI-IA (<0.05 mg/L) and below the pH(pzc),
   anionic SRHA was rapidly adsorbed onto the positively charged ZnO NPs
   hence promoting aggregation. With similar SHRA concentrations, at
   pH(pzc), SRHA was able to control the suspension behavior of the ZnO and
   promote partial disaggregation in small volumes. This was more
   distinguishable when the pH was greater than pH(pzc) as SRHA formed a

AB In many studies humic acid, fulvic acid, or natural organic matter is
   used interchangeably to model the effect of naturally derived organic
   matter on geochemical processes in the environment. In this study, the
   term NOOM (naturally occurring organic matter) is used to include both
   humic and fulvic acids as well as natural organic matter and compares
   the effect of NOOM type on NOOM removal onto nano-TiO2. In general,
   regardless of variations in solution chemistry, the order of the
   percentage of removal of NOOM onto nano-TiO2 was humic acid > natural
   organic matter > fulvic acid. The order of adsorption constant values of
   NOOM onto nano-TiO2 was also found to be humic acid > natural organic
   matter > fulvic acid under all conditions studied. The extent of NOOM
   removal by nano-TiO2 was enhanced in the presence of the divalent ions,
   magnesium and calcium, at pH 7.8 when compared to the presence of the
   monovalent ions, sodium and potassium. Also, lower NOOM removal by
   nano-TiO2 in the presence of sodium salts of dihydrogen phosphate,
   bicarbonate and nitrate relative to chloride was observed and was likely
   due to the competition between polyatomic anions and NOOM adsorption
   onto the surface of nano-TiO2 indicating an anionic effect. Low
   concentrations of NOOM (10-20 mg L-1) destabilized nano-TiO2 in
   solution, however, the stability of nano-TiO2 increased as the amount of
   NOOM adsorbed onto nano-TiO2 increased at higher dissolved NOOM
   concentrations and significant stabilization was seen at 25 mg L-1 NOOM.
   Thus, the three fractions of NOOM, humic and fulvic acids and natural
   organic matter and their concentrations were found to affect nano-TiO2
   stability to different degrees although pH dependent trends in cation
   and anion effects had similar patterns. While the effects of adsorption
   of these three commonly used types of NOOM onto nanoparticles are
   similar, there are important differences that can be related to
   structural differences. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Interactions between organic matter (OM) and engineered polymer coatings
   as they affect the retention of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)
   polymer-coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were studied. Two distinct
   types of OM-cysteine representing low molecular weight multivalent
   functional groups, and Suwannee River Humic Acid (HA) representing high
   molecular weight polymers, were investigated with respect to their
   effects on particle stability in aggregation and deposition. Aggregation
   of the PVP coated AgNPs (PVP-AgNPs) was enhanced by cysteine addition at
   high ionic strengths, which was attributed to cysteine binding to the
   AgNPs and replacing the otherwise steric stabilizing agent PVP. In
   contrast the addition of HA did not increase aggregation rates and
   decreased PVP-AgNP deposition to the silica porous medium, consistent
   with enhanced electrosteric stabilization by the HA. Although cysteine
   also reduced deposition in the porous medium, the mechanisms of reduced
   deposition appear to be enhanced electric double layer (EDL) interaction
   at low ionic strengths. At higher ionic strengths, aggregation was
   favored leading to lower deposition due to smaller diffusion
   coefficients and single collector efficiencies despite the reduced EDL
   interactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To better understand the environmental behavior, fate, and exposure
   risks of engineered nanoparticles in aquatic systems, for the first
   time, combinatorial aqueous systems were established using three-level
   orthogonal array design (OAD), an OA(27) (3(13)) matrix, to assess the
   effects of six co-varying environmental factors (organic acid type,
   organic acid concentration, NP concentration, pH, salt content, and
   electrolyte type) on the aggregation of commercial zinc oxide
   nanoparticles (ZnO NPs, mean diameter similar to 41 nm). A separate set
   of OA(27) (3(13)) experiments including temperature was conducted for
   the dissolution of these NPs. The results showed that the organic acid
   concentration and the pH were the most significant factors (p <0.001)
   influencing aggregation and dissolution of ZnO NPs, respectively. The
   electrolyte type and the salt content were the next most important
   factors in both the aggregation and dissolution. Based on the kinetics
   study of the aggregation, a high rate of the NP aggregation resulted in
   decreased dissolution, such that observed in the presence of calcium
   chloride. Clear temperature-induced aggregation and reduced dissolution
   were further observed with increasing temperature. This approach
   demonstrates that the behavior of ZnO NP may vary substantially under
   combinatorial environmental conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

AB The surface charge and average size of manufactured ZnO nanoparticles
   (NPs) were studied as a function of pH to understand the aggregation
   behavior and importance of the electrostatic interactions in solution.
   The interactions between ZnO and Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) were
   then investigated under a range of environmentally relevant conditions
   with the ZnO nanoparticles pHPZC as the point of reference. The anionic
   charges carried by aquatic humic substances were found to play a major
   role in the aggregation and disaggregation of ZnO nanoparticles. At low
   concentrations of SRHA (<0.05 mg/L) and below the pHPZC, anionic SRHA
   was rapidly adsorbed onto the positively charged ZnO NPs hence promoting
   aggregation. With similar SHRA concentrations, at pHPZC, SRHA was able
   to control the suspension behavior of the ZnO and promote partial
   disaggregation in small volumes. This was more distinguishable when the
   pH was greater than pHPZC as SRHA formed a surface coating on the ZnO
   nanoparticles and enhanced stability via electrostatic and steric
   interactions. In most cases, the NP coating by SRHA induced
   disaggregation behavior in the ZnO nanoparticles and decreased the
   aggregate size in parallel to increasing SRHA concentrations. Results
   also suggest that environmental aquatic concentration ranges of humic
   acids largely modify the stability of aggregated or dispersed ZnO
   nanoparticles.

AB The fast growing and abundant use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in
   commercial products alerts us to be cautious of their unknown health and
   environmental risks. Because of the inherent redox instability of
   silver, AgNPs are highly dynamic in the aquatic system, and the cycle of
   chemical oxidation of AgNPs to release Ag+ and reconstitution to form
   AgNPs is expected to occur in aquatic environments. This study
   investigated how inevitable environmentally relevant factors like
   sunlight, dissolved organic matter (DOM), pH, Ca2+/Mg2+, Cl-, and S2-
   individually or in combination affect the chemical transformation of
   AgNPs. It was demonstrated that simulated sunlight induced the
   aggregation of AgNPs, causing particle fusion or self-assembly to form
   larger structures and aggregates. Meanwhile, AgNPs were significantly
   stabilized by DOM, indicating that AgNPs may exist as single particles
   and be suspended in natural water for a long time or delivered far
   distances. Dissolution (ion release) kinetics of AgNPs in sunlit
   DOM-rich water showed that dissolved Ag concentration increased
   gradually first and then suddenly decreased with external light
   irradiation, along with the regeneration of new tiny AgNPs. pH variation
   and addition of Ca2+ and Mg2+ within environmental levels did not affect
   the tendency, showing that this phenomenon was general in real aquatic
   systems. Given that a great number of studies have proven the toxicity
   of dissolved Ag (commonly regarded as the source of AgNP toxicity) to
   many aquatic organisms, our finding that the effect of DOM and sunlight
   on AgNP dissolution can regulate AgNP toxicity under these conditions is
   important. The fact that the release of AS and regeneration of AgNPs
   could both happen in sunlit DOM-rich water implies that previous results
   of toxicity studies gained by focusing on the original nature of AgNPs
   should be reconsidered and highlights the necessity to monitor the fate
   and toxicity of AgNPs under more environmentally relevant conditions.

AB Manufactured nanoparticles (MNPs) are increasingly released into the
   environment and thus research on their fate and behaviour in complex
   environmental samples is urgently needed. The fate of MNPs in the
   aquatic environment will mainly depend on the physico-chemical
   characteristics of the medium. The presence and concentration of natural
   organic matter (NOM) will play a significant role on the stability of
   MNPs by either decreasing or exacerbating the aggregation phenomenon. In
   this study, we firstly investigated the effect of NOM concentration on
   the aggregation behaviour of manufactured Fe-oxide nanoparticles. Then,
   the stability of the coated nanoparticles was assessed under relevant
   environmental conditions. Flow field-flow fractionation, an emerging
   method which is gaining popularity in the field of nanotechnology, has
   been employed and results have been compared to another size-measurement
   technique to provide increased confidence in the outcomes. Results
   showed enhanced stability when the nanoparticles are coated with NOM,
   which was due to electrosteric stabilisation. However, the presence of
   divalent cations, even at low concentration (i.e. less than 1 mM) was
   found to induce aggregation of NOM-coated nanoparticles via bridging
   mechanisms between NOM and Ca2+.

AB A novel type of organic binder, modified humic acid (MHA), has been
   developed and patented in China. Humic acid (HA) is one of the main
   active fractions in the MHA binder. In this study, adsorption of HA onto
   natural magnetite, hematite and quartz surfaces as a function of initial
   HA concentration was comparatively investigated. It was found that the
   initial HA concentration has a positive effect on the adsorbance of HA
   onto magnetite and hematite surfaces but HA was hardly adsorbed by
   quartz particles even if the initial HA concentration was very high.
   When increasing the initial HA concentration, the zeta potential of
   magnetite/hematite particles became more negative because the negatively
   charged HA molecules entered into the electric double layer of the iron
   ore particles, while there was nearly no change in the zeta potential of
   quartz particles. There was less change in the zeta potential of
   magnetite compared to that of hematite. DRIFTS studies showed that there
   was a stronger chemisorption between the HA molecules and the iron ore
   surfaces under alkaline conditions. ESEM images further confirmed that
   magnetite particles coated by HA easily clustered to form agglomerates
   via chemisorption and physisorption, and the aggregates bonded together
   with HA by chemisorption were more resistant to breakage, which would be
   beneficial for the strength of green pellets. [All rights reserved

AB Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) may be released into surface waters, where
   they can affect aquatic organisms. However, agglomeration, dissolution,
   surface modifications and chemical speciation are important processes
   that control the toxicity of AgNPs. The purpose of the study was to
   apply various methods for monitoring the persistence and transformation
   of AgNPs added to littoral lake mesocosms. Analysis of total Ag showed
   that the levels in the mesocosms declined rapidly in the first 12 h
   after addition, followed by a slower rate of dissipation with a
   half-life (t(1/2)) of similar to 20 days. Analysis using single particle
   ICP-MS (spICP-MS) showed no evidence of extensive homo-agglomeration of
   AgNPs. The stability of AgNPs was likely due to the low ionic strength
   and high concentrations of humic-rich dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in
   the lake water. Analyses by spICP-MS, cloud point extraction (CPE) and
   asymmetric flow field flow fractionation coupled to ICP-MS (AF4-ICP-MS)
   all indicated that the concentrations of AgNP decreased over time, and
   the nanoparticles underwent dissolution. However, the concentrations of
   dissolved silver, which includes Ag+, were generally below detection
   limits when analysed by centrifugal ultrafiltration and spICP-MS. It is
   likely that the majority of free ions released by dissolution were
   complexing with natural organic material, such as DOC. An association
   with DOC would be expected to reduce the toxicity of Ag+ in natural
   waters. Overall, we were able to characterise AgNP transformations in
   natural waters at toxicologically relevant concentrations through the
   use of multiple analytical techniques that compensate for the
   limitations of the individual methods.

AB The capping layer stabilizing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) affects its
   aggregation, dissolution, and net disinfection action, especially under
   conditions of varying water composition, such as, pH, ionic strength and
   organic matter content. Herein, we correlate the silver ion (Ag+)
   release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation rates for AgNPs of
   varying functionalization to their net disinfection coefficient on
   Escherichia coli, under conditions of differing water chemistries. For
   electrostatically stabilized citrate-capped AgNPs, the rate of ROS
   generation, as measured using a fluorescent dye, is found to dominate
   over that of Ag+ release, especially for smaller sized AgNP suspensions
   (similar to 10 nm) at low pH (similar to 6.2). For these AgNPs, the ROS
   disinfection mechanism is confirmed to dominate net disinfection action,
   as measured by the live/dead assay, especially at low levels of organic
   matter. Steric stabilization of AgNPs by protein or starch-capped layers
   enables disinfection through reducing AgNP aggregation and promoting
   silver dissolution over ROS generation. We suggest the involvement of
   protons and dissolved oxygen in causing the independent formation of Ag+
   and ROS, regardless of the AgNP capping layer. While protein-capping
   layers effectively stabilize AgNPs, the generated ROS is likely
   dissipated by interference with the bulky capping layer, whereas the
   interference is lower with citrate-capping layers. Steric stabilization
   of AgNPs enables disinfection within a wide range of water chemistries,
   whereas effective disinfection can occur under electrostatic
   stabilization, only at low NaCl (<1 mmol/L) and organic matter (<5 mg/L)
   levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mercuric sulfide species are likely the predominant forms of mercury
   (Hg) in anoxic environments where the bioavailability of Hg is a key
   factor for the production of methylmercury (MeHg) by microorganisms.
   Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is known to affect the formation,
   aggregation, and dissolution of HgS particles; however the connection of
   these processes to Hg bioavailability is not well understood. The
   objectives of this study were to gain insights into the molecular
   structure and aggregation properties of nanoscale HgS particles that
   were formed and aged in the presence of DOM and to link this information
   to bioavailability for methylating bacteria. Characterization of
   nanoscale HgS was performed with a series of techniques including
   transmission electron microscopy, photon scattering, X-ray diffraction,
   and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The characterization results
   indicated that the HgS precipitates formed were metacinnabar-like
   spherical nanoparticles that were 3-5 nm in diameter. Over the course of
   the aging process, HgS nanoparticles (nano-HgS) agglomerated to form
   mass-fractal aggregates, although the size of each primary particle
   within the aggregates remained unchanged. Furthermore, the crystallinity
   of nano-HgS increased as the particles aged. The methylation potential
   of nano-HgS by sulfate-reducing bacteria decreased during the aging
   process. No clear correlation was observed between the net productions
   of MeHg and the concentrations of dissolved Hg(II) in the culture media,
   suggesting that the decrease in the methylation potential of aged
   nano-HgS was not simply because of the slower supply of dissolved Hg(II)
   by nano-HgS. While the link between the aging of nano-HgS and decrease
   of methylation potential is not fully understood, the results of our
   study indicate that freshly formed HgS particles in DOM-rich water will
   include a variety of nanoscale structures that have a wide range of
   methylation potentials. This knowledge provides a basis for better
   prediction of mercury bioavailability and MeHg production in
   contaminated environments.

AB Palladium-doped nanosized zerovalent iron (Pd-NZVI) particles can
   contribute to the transformation of chlorinated solvents and various
   other contaminants into innocuous products. To make Pd-NZVI an effective
   in situ subsurface remediation agent, these particles need to migrate
   through a targeted contaminated area. However, previous studies have
   reported very limited mobility of these particles in the groundwater
   environment and attributed it to rapid aggregation and subsequent pore
   plugging In this study, we systematically investigated the influence of
   selected natural and nontoxic organic macromolecules (carboxymethyl
   cellulose, rhamnolipid biosurfactants, and soy protein) on the
   aggregation and transport behavior of bare and coated Pd-NZVI.
   Aggregation behavior was investigated using dynamic light scattering by
   monitoring the evolution of hydrodynamic diameter as a function of time,
   whereas transport behavior was investigated by conducting
   water-saturated sand-packed column experiments. While bare Pd-NZVI is
   prone to rapid aggregation, we observed good colloidal stability and
   concurrent enhanced transport of Pd-NZVI coated with carboxymethyl
   cellulose, rhamnolipid biosurfactants, and soy protein. Each surface
   modifier performed well at lower ionic strength (IS) (10 mM NaHCO3), and
   one of the rhamnolipid surface modifiers (JBR215) significantly enhanced
   transport of 150 mg/L Pd-NZVI at concentrations as low as 10 mg/L total
   organic carbon. However, an increase in the solution IS induced
   significant Pd-NZVI aggregation with a simultaneous decrease in the
   transport potential in accordance with the DLVO (Derjaguin, Landau,
   Verwey, and Overbeek) theory of colloidal stability. Nonetheless, at the
   highest IS (300 mM NaHCO3) investigated, the mobility of
   rhamnolipid-coated Pd-NZVI is significantly higher than that of Pd-NZVI
   coated with the other surface modifiers, suggesting that biosurfactants
   may be the most suitable surface modifiers in field application.
   Overall, this study emphasizes how stabilization of Pd-NZVI with natural
   macromolecules such as rhamnolipids can improve the transport potential
   of these reactive nanoparticles in subsurface remediation applications
   at concentrations significantly lower than those of other commonly used
   polymers.

AB Emerging nanomaterials are being manufactured with varying particle
   sizes, morphologies, and crystal structures in the pursuit of achieving
   outstanding functional properties. These variations in these key
   material properties of nanoparticles may affect their environmental fate
   and transport. To date, few studies have investigated this important
   aspect of nanoparticles' environmental behavior. In this study, the
   aggregation kinetics of ten different TiO2 nanoparticles (5 anatase and
   5 rutile each with varying size) was systematically evaluated. Our
   results show that, as particle size increases, the surface charge of
   both anatase and rutile TiO2 nanoparticles shifts toward a more negative
   value, and, accordingly, the point of zero charge shifts toward a lower
   value. The colloidal stability of anatase sphere samples agreed well
   with DLVO theoretical predictions, where an increase in particle size
   led to a higher energy barrier and therefore greater critical
   coagulation concentration. In contrast, the critical coagulation
   concentration of rutile rod samples correlated positively with the
   specific surface area, i.e., samples with higher specific surface area
   exhibited higher stability. Finally, due to the large innate negative
   surface charge of all the TiO2 samples at the pH value (pH = 8) tested,
   the addition of natural organic matter was observed to have minimal
   effect on TiO2 aggregation kinetics, except for the smallest rutile rods
   that showed decreased stability in the presence of natural organic
   matter.

AB Key understanding of potential transformations that may occur on silver
   nanoparticle (AgNP) surface upon interaction with naturally ubiquitous
   organic ligands (e.g., -SH (thou), humic acid, or -COO (carboxylate)) is
   limited. Herein we investigated how dissolved organic carbon (DOC), -SH
   (in cysteine, a well-known Ag+ chelating agent), and -COO (in trolox, a
   well-known antioxidant) could alter the colloidal stability, dissolution
   rate, and toxicity of citrate-functionalized AgNPs (citrate-AgNPs)
   against a keystone crustacean Daphnia magna. Cysteine, DOC, or trolox
   amendment of citrate-AgNPs differentially modified particle size,
   surface properties (charge, plasmonic spectra), and ion release
   dynamics, thereby attenuating (with cysteine or trolox) or promoting
   (with DOC) AgNP toxicity. Except with DOC amendment, the combined
   toxicity of AgNPs and released Ag under cysteine or trolox amendment was
   lower than of AgNO3 alone. The results of this study show that
   citrate-AgNP toxicity can be associated with oxidative stress, ion
   release, and the organism biology. Our evidence suggests that specific
   organic ligands available in the receiving waters can differentially
   surface modify AgNPs and alter their environmental persistence (changing
   dissolution dynamics) and subsequently the toxicity; hence, we caveat to
   generalize that surface modified nanoparticles upon environmental
   release may not be toxic to receptor organisms.

AB Stability of nanoparticles (NPs) and their sorption on different
   environmental surfaces have important implications for their fate and
   transport in aquatic systems. The surfaces of both NPs and soil/sediment
   minerals are likely to encounter environmental organics including
   natural organic matter (NOM) and extracellular polymeric substances
   (EPS) under relevant environmental conditions. The aim of this paper was
   to explore the potential modes of silver NP (AgNP) interaction with NOM
   and a model EPS. Molecular spectroscopies were used to characterize the
   interactions of NOM with the AgNP-capping agents (citrate and
   polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)). NMR spectroscopy suggests that both the
   humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) fractions of NOM are capable of
   displacing citrate from the surface of AgNPs. The relaxation times of
   methylene (CH2 and CH) protons provide indirect evidence that carboxyl
   or hydroxyl groups of FA interact with the surface of AgNPs. Raman
   spectroscopy suggests that FA interacts with both the ring and polyvinyl
   domains of PVP and the oxygen atom involved in the PVP NP complex. These
   spectroscopic results imply that the displacement of AgNP capping agents
   by NOM may have a destabilizing effect on engineered NPs that enter the
   aqueous environment, thus reducing their environmental mobility. Quartz
   crystal microgravimetry (QCM) revealed observable differences in both
   the extent and kinetics of AgNP adsorption on substrates coated with NOM
   and dextran sulfate. These exploratory QCM results are crucial in
   guiding future research to further investigate the role of
   NOM/EPS-induced adsorption in influencing environmental partitioning of
   NPs. Overall, our preliminary assessment highlighted the critical role
   of surface modifications of both the NPs and the bulk substrate by
   environmental organics in the stability and mobility of AgNPs. These
   initial findings are important in the future design of NPs to ensure
   successful targeted applications as well as the environmental health and
   safety of NPs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The adsorption of different organic acids and their influence on the
   pH-dependent charging, salt tolerance and so the colloidal stability of
   magnetite nanoparticles are compared. Adsorption isotherms of citric
   acid - CA, gallic acid - GA, poly(acrylic acid) - PAA,
   poly(acrylic-co-maleic acid) - PAM and humic acid - HA were measured.
   The pH-dependent charge state of MNPs was characterized by
   electrophoretic mobility and their aggregation by dynamic light
   scattering. The salt tolerance was tested in coagulation kinetic
   experiments. Although the adsorption capacities, the type of bonding
   (either H-bonds or metal ion-carboxylate complexes) and so the bond
   strengths are significantly different, the following general trends have
   been found. Small amount of organic acids at pH <similar to 8 (the pH of
   PZC of magnetite) - relevant condition in natural waters - only
   neutralizes the positive charges, and so promotes the aggregation and
   sedimentation of nanoparticles. Greater amounts of organic acid, above
   the charge neutralization, cause the sign reversal of particle charge,
   and at high overcharging promote stabilization and dispersing. The
   thicker layer of PAA, PAM and HA provides better electrosteric stability
   than CA and GA. GA undergoes surface polymerization, thereby improving
   stabilization. The organic acids studied here eliminate completely the
   pH sensitivity of amphoteric magnetite, but only the polyanionic
   coverage provides significant increase in resistance against coagulating
   effects of salts at neutral pH commonly prevailing in natural waters.

AB The behavior of manufactured TiO2 nanoparticles is studied in a
   systematic way in presence of alginate and Suwannee River humic acids at
   variable concentrations. TiO2 nanoparticles aggregation, disaggregation
   and stabilization are investigated using dynamic light scattering and
   electrophoretic experiments allowing the measurement of z-average
   hydrodynamic diameters and zeta potential values. Stability of the TiO2
   nanoparticles is discussed by considering three pH-dependent
   electrostatic scenarios. In the first scenario, when pH is below the
   TiO2 nanoparticle point of zero charge, nanoparticles exhibit a
   positively charged surface whereas alginate and Suwannee River humic
   acids are negatively charged. Fast adsorption at the TiO2 nanoparticles
   occurs, promotes surface charge neutralization and aggregation. By
   increasing further alginate and Suwannee River humic acids
   concentrations charge inversion and stabilization of TiO2 nanoparticles
   are obtained. In the second electrostatic scenario, at the surface
   charge neutralization pH, TiO2 nanoparticles are rapidly forming
   aggregates. Adsorption of alginate and Suwannee River humic acids on
   aggregates leads to their partial fragmentation. In the third
   electrostatic scenario, when nanoparticles, alginate and Suwannee River
   humic acids are negatively charged, only a small amount of Suwannee
   River humic acids is adsorbed on TiO2 nanoparticles surface. It is found
   that the fate and behavior of individual and aggregated TiO2
   nanoparticles in presence of environmental compounds are mainly driven
   by the complex interplay between electrostatic attractive and repulsive
   interactions, steric and van der Weals interactions, as well as
   concentration ratio. Results also suggest that environmental aquatic
   concentration ranges of humic acids and biopolymers largely modify the
   stability of aggregated or dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles. (C) 2013

   2), titanate nanotubes (TNs), and titanate nanotubes-TiO 2 (TNs-TiO 2)

   influences of pH, ionic strength (Na + and Ca 2+) and natural organic
   matter (humic acid, HA) on aggregate size, zeta potential and
   sedimentation rate were totally investigated. It was found that maximum
   aggregation invariably occurred at pH close to point of zero charge.
   However, the three nanomaterials underwent different aggregation
   processes, even though aggregation was always greatly enhanced with
   increasing ionic strength in either Na + or Ca 2+ solutions. In Ca 2+
   solutions, the aggregate size of TiO 2 tended to increase solely with
   increasing ionic strength, while the size of TNs and TNs-TiO 2 increased
   initially before decreasing, due to the surface charge changing from
   negative to positive at high ionic strengths. The aggregation energy
   barrier was enhanced considerably by HA, thus inhibiting aggregation.
   TNs and TNs-TiO 2 exhibited a greater energy barrier transition than TiO
   2 due to their higher adsorption capacity for HA, and moreover, the
   co-existence of Ca 2+ also exhibited ion bridge effects on aggregation.
   Different microstructure and chemical composition of the nanomaterials
   resulted in different aggregation and sedimentation behaviors, and the

AB BACKGROUND: Use of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) in consumer products
   is resulting in NPs in drinking water sources. Subsequent NP
   breakthrough into treated drinking water is a potential exposure route
   and human health threat.
   OBJECTIVES: In this study we investigated the breakthrough of common
   NPs--silver (Ag), titanium dioxide (TiO2), and zinc oxide (ZnO)--into
   finished drinking water following conventional and advanced treatment.
   METHODS: NPs were spiked into five experimental waters: groundwater,
   surface water, synthetic freshwater, synthetic freshwater containing
   natural organic matter, and tertiary wastewater effluent. Bench-scale
   coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation simulated conventional treatment,
   and microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) simulated advanced
   treatment. We monitored breakthrough of NPs into treated water by
   turbidity removal and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry
   (ICP-MS).
   RESULTS: Conventional treatment resulted in 2-20%, 3-8%, and 48-99% of
   Ag, TiO2, and ZnO NPs, respectively, or their dissolved ions remaining
   in finished water. Breakthrough following MF was 1-45% for Ag, 0-44% for
   TiO2, and 36-83% for ZnO. With UF, NP breakthrough was 0-2%, 0-4%, and
   2-96% for Ag, TiO2, and ZnO, respectively. Variability was dependent on
   NP stability, with less breakthrough of aggregated NPs compared with
   stable NPs and dissolved NP ions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although a majority of aggregated or stable NPs were
   removed by simulated conventional and advanced treatment, NP metals were
   detectable in finished water. As environmental NP concentrations
   increase, we need to consider NPs as emerging drinking water
   contaminants and determine appropriate drinking water treatment
   processes to fully remove NPs in order to reduce their potential harmful
   health outcomes.

AB Natural organic matter (NOM) exerts strong influence on copper
   speciation and bioavailability in soils and aquatic systems. In
   redox-dynamic environments, electron transfer reactions between copper
   and redox-active moieties of NOM may trigger Cu(I) and Cu(0) formation.
   To date, little is known about Cu-NOM redox interactions and Cu(1)
   binding to NOM. Here, we present X-ray absorption spectroscopy results
   on copper redox transformations upon addition of Cu(II) or Cu(I)to
   untreated and electrochemically reduced soil humic acid (HA) under oxic
   and anoxic conditions. Both untreated and reduced HA mediated copper
   redox transformations. Under anoxic conditions, Cu(II) and Cu(I) added
   to reduced HA were primarily complexed and thereby stabilized as
   Cu(I)-HA at low loadings, whereas high copper loadings resulted in the
   additional formation of Cu(0) nanoparticles (16-64% of total copper).
   Cu(I) bound to HA was predominantly 2-fold coordinated and to a lower
   extent 3- to 4-fold coordinated, with a contribution of at least one
   nitrogen and/or sulfur ligand group. Under oxic conditions, Cu(II)-HA
   complexes prevailed, but smaller fractions of copper were also
   stabilized as Cu(I)-HA in a 3- to 4-fold coordination. Our results show
   that Cu-HA redox interactions are strongly affected by binding of Cu(II)
   and Cu(I) to HA and that HA contributes to the stabilization of Cu(I)
   against disproportionation.

   greatly. The steric repulsive forces, originated from organic layers
   adsorbed on MnO2 colloidal surfaces, may be mainly responsible for their
   stabilizing effects. However, the complexes formed by alginate and Ca2+
   (>5 mM) might play a bridging role and thus enhanced MnO2 colloidal
   aggregation instead. These results may be important for assessing the
   fate and transport of MnO2 colloids and associated contaminants.

AB The increased use of silver nanomaterials presents a risk to aquatic
   systems due to the high toxicity of silver. The stability, dissolution
   rates and toxicity of citrate- and polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated silver
   nanoparticles (AgNPs) were investigated in synthetic freshwater and
   natural seawater media, with the effects of natural organic matter
   investigated in freshwater. When sterically stabilised by the large PVP
   molecules, AgNPs were more stable than when charge-stabilised using
   citrate, and were even relatively stable in seawater. In freshwater and
   seawater, citrate-coated AgNPs (Ag-Cit) had a faster rate of dissolution
   than PVP-coated AgNPs (Ag-PVP), while micron-sized silver exhibited the
   slowest dissolution rate. However, similar dissolved silver was measured
   for both AgNPs after 72 h in freshwater (500-600 mu g L-1) and seawater
   (1300-1500 mu g L-1), with higher concentrations in seawater attributed
   to chloride complexation. When determined on a mass basis, the 72-h IC50
   (inhibitory concentration giving 50% reduction in algal growth rate) for
   Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Phaeodactylum tricornutum and the
   48-h LC50 for Ceriodaphnia dubia exposure to Ag+ (1.1, 400 and 0.11 mu g
   L-1, respectively), Ag-Cit (3.0, 2380 and 0.15 mu g L-1, respectively)
   and Ag-PVP (19.5, 3690 and 2.0 mu g L-1, respectively) varied widely,
   with toxicity in the order Ag+ > Ag-Cit > Ag-PVP. Micron-sized silver
   treatments elicited much lower toxicity than ionic Ag+ or AgNP to P.
   subcapitata. However, when related to the dissolved silver released from
   the nanoparticles the toxicities were similar to ionic silver
   treatments. The presence of natural organic matter stabilised the
   particles and reduced toxicity in freshwater. These results indicate
   that dissolved silver was responsible for the toxicity and highlight the
   need to account for matrix components such as chloride and organic
   matter in natural waters that influence AgNP fate and mitigate toxicity.

AB Many engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) are functionalized with different
   types of surface coatings to suit specific applications. The
   functionalization affects the fate and behavior of these ENPs in aquatic
   environments. In this study, gold nanoparticles (GNPs) coated with
   either citrate or 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) are used as examples
   of functionalized ENPs. A method has been developed to assess the
   colloidal stability of functionalized ENPs under complex hydrochemical
   conditions, using their aggregation rates as indicators. The spatial
   distributions of stream-water chemistry data from across Europe were
   combined with the results of in-vitro colloidal stability testing.
   Aggregation rates were extracted for each stream-water sample and
   stability maps for Europe were plotted. The tendency of the tested GNPs
   to be dispersed or aggregated is described for water bodies of the
   respective region. Natural organic matter was identified as the
   predominant factor controlling the stability of the GNPs tested. The
   properties of surface coatings also affect aggregation rates as a result
   of differences in their hydrochemical parameters. The developed method
   can be used as a template for a stability assessment, and the results of
   this study provide a basis for exposure modeling and precautionary
   decision making. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Iron oxide nanoparticles are becoming increasingly popular for various
   applications including the treatment of contaminated soil and
   groundwater; however, their mobility and reactivity in the subsurface
   environment are significantly affected by their tendency to aggregate.
   One solution to overcome this issue is to coat the nanoparticles with
   dissolved organic matter (DOM). The advantages of DOM over conventional
   surface modifiers are that DOM is naturally abundant in the environment,
   inexpensive, non-toxic and readily adsorbed onto the surface of metal
   oxide nanoparticles.
   In this study, humic acid (HA) and Suwannee River natural organic matter
   (SRNOM) were tested and compared as surface modifiers for Fe2O3
   nanoparticles (NPs). The DOM-coated Fe2O3 NPs were characterised by
   various analytical methods including: flow field-flow fractionation
   (FIFFF), high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) and
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The stability of the
   coated NPs was then evaluated by assessing their aggregation and
   disaggregation behaviour over time.
   Results showed that both HA and SRNOM were rapidly and readily adsorbed
   on the surface of Fe2O3 NPs, providing electrosteric stabilisation over
   a wide range of pH. HPSEC results showed that the higher molecular
   weight components of DOM were preferentially adsorbed onto the surface
   of Fe2O3. As SRNOM consists of macromolecules with a higher molecular
   weight than HA, the measured size of the SRNOM-coated Fe2O3 NPs was 30%
   larger than the HA-coated Fe2O3 NPs. FTIR results indicated the
   occurrence of hydrogen bonding arising from electrostatic interaction
   between the DOM and Fe2O3 NPs. Finally, a stability study showed that
   after 14 days, small agglomerates and aggregates were formed. The
   HA-coated Fe2O3 NPs formed agglomerates which were easily disaggregated
   using a vortex mixer, with the coated NPs returning to their initial
   size. However, SRNOM-coated Fe2O3 NPs were only partially disaggregated
   using the same method, which indicates that these aggregates have a more
   compact structure. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Iron nanoparticles are becoming increasingly popular for the treatment
   of contaminated soil and groundwater; however, their mobility and
   reactivity in subsurface environments are significantly affected by
   their tendency to aggregate. Assessing their stability under
   environmental conditions is crucial for determining their environmental
   fate. A multi-method approach (including different size-measurement
   techniques and the DLVO theory) was used to thoroughly characterise the
   behaviour of iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe(2)O(3)NPs) under
   environmentally relevant conditions. Although recent studies have
   demonstrated the importance of using a multi-method approach when
   characterising nanoparticles, the majority of current studies continue
   to use a single-method approach.
   Under some soil conditions (i.e. pH 7, 10 mM NaCl and 2 mM CaCl2) and
   increasing particle concentration, Fe(2)O(3)NPs underwent extensive
   aggregation to form large aggregates (>1 mu m). Coating the
   nanoparticles with dissolved organic matter (DOM) was investigated as an
   alternative "green" solution to overcoming the aggregation issue instead
   of using the more commonly proposed polyelectrolytes. At high
   concentrations, DOM effectively covered the surface of the Fe(2)O(3)NPs,
   thereby conferring negative surface charge on the particles across a
   wide range of pH values. This provided electrostatic stabilisation and
   considerably reduced the particle aggregation effect. DOM-coated
   Fe(2)O(3)NPs also proved to be more stable under high ionic strength
   conditions. The presence of CaCl2, however, even at low concentrations,
   induced the aggregation of DOM-coated Fe(2)O(3)NPs, mainly via charge
   neutralisation and bridging. This has significant implications in
   regards to the reactivity and fate of these materials in the
   environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The eventual future scenario of a release of nanomaterials into the
   environment makes it necessary to assess the risk involved in their use
   by studying their behavior in natural waters. NanoTiO(2) is one of the
   most commonly employed nanomaterials. In the present work we studied the
   aggregation rates, aggregate size and aggregate morphology of NanoTiO(2)
   under the presence of inert electrolytes, divalent cations, and these
   two combined with natural organic matter, in an effort to provide a
   comprehensive investigation of the phenomena of interaction of
   nanomaterials and natural waters and elucidate some of the conflicting
   information reported in the literature. The stability of nanoparticles
   could be explained in all cases, at least qualitatively, in terms of
   classical DLVO interactions (Electrical Double Layer, Van der Waals).
   Divalent cations were adsorbed to the surface of the nanoparticles,
   neutralizing the negative charge at pH values greater than the point of
   zero charge and inducing aggregation. Natural organic matter (NOM)
   adsorbed to the particles and made their zeta potential more negative,
   hence stabilizing them by lowering the pH of maximum aggregation.
   Divalent cations partially neutralized the adsorbed NOM, and at high
   concentrations aggregation was observed with Ca2+ but not Mg2+,
   suggesting the presence of specific Ca2+-NOM bridges. SEM images
   visually revealed a fractal-like morphology of the aggregates formed
   under unfavorable conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The dynamic nature of nanoparticle (NP) aggregation behavior is of
   paramount interest to many current studies in environmental and
   toxicological nanoscience. The present study seeks to elucidate the
   influence that different electrolytes have on the aggregation of
   citrate-coated silver NPs (cit-AgNPs). The use of both UV-vis
   spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS, both z-average
   hydrodynamic diameter (z-d(h)) and size distribution analysis data)
   allowed improvement in the data quality and interpretation as compared
   to other studies using only DLS and reporting solely the z-d(h), as the
   change in the z-d(h) can be related to analytical errors and
   uncertainties rather than only aggregation or dissolution of NPs.
   Divalent cations (CaCl2, Ca(NO3)(2), CaSO4, MgCl2 and MgSO4) have
   stronger influence (ca. 50-65 fold) on aggregation of cit-AgNPs as
   compared to monovalent cations (NaCl, NaNO3, Na2SO4), as expected. For
   electrolytes with monovalent cations, there was no specific ion effect
   of nitrate and sulfate anions. However, the addition of chloride anions
   resulted in enhanced apparent aggregation, possibly due to the formation
   of AgCl NPs that sorb/attach to the surface of cit-AgNPs. Suwannee River
   fulvic acid enhances the stability of cit-AgNPs and shifts the critical
   coagulation concentrations to higher electrolyte concentrations for all
   types of electrolytes. Aggregation kinetics in the presence of mixture
   of monovalent and divalent cations is additive and controlled by the
   dominant cations. An empirical formula (alpha(mixture) = alpha(Na) + (50
   to 65)Ca) is proposed that reproduces the effect of mixtures of
   electrolytes in the presence of humic substances and cations that can be
   used to help predict the aggregation behavior of cit-AgNPs in
   environmental and ecotoxicological media. 0 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Understanding the colloidal stability of functionalized engineered
   nanoparticles (FENPs) in aquatic environments is of paramount importance
   in order to assess the risk related to FENPs. In this study, gold
   nanoparticles (GNPs) of 68 and 43 nm diameter, coated with citrate and
   11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) respectively, were used as models of
   FENPs. Time resolved dynamic light scattering was employed to
   investigate the aggregation kinetics of two types of GNPs. The results
   show that without Suwannee river natural organic matter (SRNOM), MUA
   coating resulted in greater stability than citrate coating for GNPs.
   Cations have a destabilizing effect on both GNPs following the order
   Ca2+ approximate to Mg2+ >> Na+; different anions (Cl- and SO42-) showed
   no difference in effects. In the fast aggregation regime, adding SRNOM
   enhanced the stability of MUA-coated GNPs in both Ca2+ and Mg2+
   solutions. However citrate coated GNPs were only stabilized in Mg2+
   solution but enhanced aggregation occurred in high Ca2+ concentration
   due to interparticle bridging. For the investigated GNPs and in the
   presence of SRNOM, Ca2+ does not always act as a strong coagulant This
   indicates that for the new materials emerging from the application of
   nanotechnology the well described aggregation mechanisms of colloids in
   the environment require a detailed re-examination.

   fractions (separated by a 100,000 g/mol ultrafiltration membrane) on
   gold NP aggregation are compared. The weight average molecular weight,
   M-w, for the unfractionated NOM was 23,300 g/mol, determined by size
   exclusion chromatography with multiangle light scattering. The NOM was
   comprised of similar to 1.8 wt% of >100,000 g/mol retentate NOMr,(.) M-w
   = 691,000 g/mol) and 98 wt % of filtrate (NOMf, M-w = 12,800 g/mol). Ten
   ppm of NOMr provided significantly better NP stability against
   aggregation than 10 ppm of NOMf in 100 mM NaCl due to steric effects. In
   the unfractionated NOM, the relative importance of the two components
   was concentration-dependent For a low concentration of unfractionated
   NOM (10 ppm), both fractions contributed to the NOM effects; for a high
   concentration (560 ppm), NP stability was controlled by the small amount
   (10 ppm) of NOM, present, rather than the higher amount (550 ppm) of
   NOMf. Therefore, large humic aggregates in a heterogeneous NOM sample
   can have disproportionately strong effects, and characterization of M-w
   distributions (rather than average M-w) may be required to explain NOM
   effects on NP behavior.

AB Titanium dioxide nanoparticle (TiO2NP) suspension stability can be
   altered by adsorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM). This is
   expected to impact their environmental fate and bioavailabllity. To
   date, the influence of DOM on the toxicity of TiO(2)NPs to aquatic
   vertebrates has not been reported. We examined the impact of Suwannee
   River humic acid (HA) on the toxicity of TiO(2)NPs to developing
   zebrafish (Danio rerio) in the dark and under simulated sunlight
   illumination. Adsorption of HA increased suspension stability and
   decreased TiO2NP exposure. TiO(2)NPs were more toxic in the presence of
   HA. In the absence of simulated sunlight, a small but significant
   increase in lethality was observed in fish exposed to TiO(2)NPs in the
   presence of HA. Under simulated sunlight illumination, photocatalytic
   degradation of HA reduced suspension stability. Despite the lower
   concentrations of Ti associated with fish in the treatments containing
   HA, under simulated sunlight illumination, median lethal concentrations
   were lower and oxidative DNA damage was elevated relative to fish
   exposed to TiO(2)NPs in the absence of HA. This study demonstrates the
   importance of considering environmental factors (i.e., exposure to
   sunlight, adsorption of DOM) when assessing the potential risks posed by
   engineered nanomaterials in the environment.

AB To decrease aggregation and enhance the mobility of nano zero-valent
   iron (NZVI) used for in-situ groundwater remediation, the surface of
   such NZVI must be modified using organic stabilizers, which can provide
   electrostatic repulsion, and steric or electrosteric stabilization.
   However, the stability of the nanoparticles can also be affected by
   groundwater components such as cations and humic acid (HA). In this
   study, the effect of Ca2+ on the colloidal stability of NZVI coated with
   three types of stabilizers (i.e., polyacrylic acid (FAA), Tween-20 and
   starch) was evaluated in the absence or presence of HA. Differing
   stability behavior was observed for different surface-modified NZVIs.
   The presence of Ca2+ exerted a slight influence on the settling of NZVI
   modified with FAA or Tween-20, in the absence or presence of HA.
   However, the presence of Ca2+ caused significant aggregation and
   sedimentation for starch-modified NZVI in the absence of HA, and induced
   an even higher degree of aggregation and sedimentation in the presence
   of HA. It is presumed that, in the absence of HA, starch-modified NZVI
   particles undergo attachment with each other via Ca2+ complexation with
   the coated starch molecules on the surface of the particles, thus
   enhancing the aggregation and the following sedimentation of
   starch-modified NZVI. However, in the presence of HA, spectroscopic
   analysis of the starch-modified NZVI aggregates indicated that the
   bridging interaction of HA with Ca2+ was the predominant mechanism for
   the enhanced aggregation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aggregation and disaggregation of particle colloids are one of the most
   important surface-driven phenomena encountered in the aquatic and
   terrestrial environments and a key factor controlling a number of
   important environmental processes. This study investigates the effects
   of pH, ionic strength, and humic acid concentration on the stability
   behavior of Fe(III)-montmorillonite, a natural colloid commonly present
   in natural waters. Time-resolved dynamic light scattering was used to
   monitor the increase of the aggregate size over time in the aggregation
   kinetics experiments. Aggregation rate, stability ratio, and CCC
   (critical coagulation concentration) were calculated to quantify the
   experimental results, and the DLVO theory was employed to explain the
   observed behaviors. The effect of humic acid on the colloidal
   electrosteric stability was also investigated. This study demonstrates
   that low pH and high ionic strength may destabilize
   Fe(III)-montmorillonite suspensions, while increasing humic acid
   concentrations has the opposite effect, stabilizing the suspension at
   any pH. Comparing the steric and electrostatic effects on the Fe-M
   stabilization, both have an important influence for all pH levels
   studied, although steric is more pronounced at low pH and high ionic
   strength. DLVO energy predictions support the experimental results. The
   obtained results contribute to the understanding of the behavior of
   colloidal particles in saline or freshwater natural environments as well
   as the role of humic acid in the mobility of contaminants associated
   with natural colloids. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are expected to be an important
   source for the formation of mineral-organic associations in soil.
   Because such formations affect the composition of mobile and immobile
   organic matter as well as the reactivity of minerals, we investigated
   the composition of EPS before and after adsorption to goethite. Raman
   measurements on EPS extracted from Bacillus subtilis distinguished four
   fractions rich in proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, or lipids and
   proteins. Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy identified three
   different EPS-fractions that varied in their composition in proteins,
   nonaromatic proteins, and polysaccharides. Reaction of EPS with goethite
   led to a preferential adsorption of lipids and proteins. The organic
   coverage was heterogeneous, consisting of similar to 100 X 200 nm large
   patches of either lipid-rich or protein-rich material. Nanoscale
   secondary ion mass spectrometry showed a strong S enrichment in
   aggregates of similar to 400 nm in the goethite adsorbed EPS. From our
   simplified model system, we learned that only a small portion (<10%) of
   EPS was immobilized via adsorption to goethite. This fraction formed a
   coating of sub mu m spaced protein-rich and lipid-rich domains, i.e., of
   two materials which will strongly differ in their reactive sites. This
   will finally affect further adsorption, the particle mobility and
   eventually also colloidal stability.

AB An important aspect in risk assessment of nanoparticles (NPs) is to
   understand their environmental interactions. We used hydroponic plant
   cultures to study nanoparticle-plant-root interaction and translocation
   and exposed wheat and pumpkin to suspensions of uncoated CeO2-NP for 8 d
   (primary particle size 17-100 nm, 100 mg L-1) in the absence and
   presence of fulvic acid (FA) and gum arabic (GA) as representatives of
   different types of natural organic matter. The behavior of CeO2-NPs in
   the hydroponic solution was monitored regarding agglomeration,
   sedimentation, particle size distribution, surface charge, amounts of
   root association, and translocation into shoots. NP-dispersions were
   stable over 8 d in the presence of FA or GA, but with growing plants,
   changes in pH, particle agglomeration rate, and hydrodynamic diameter
   were observed. None of the plants exhibited reduced growth or any toxic
   response during the experiment. We found that CeO2-NPs translocated into
   pumpkin shoots, whereas this did not occur in wheat plants. The presence
   of FA and GA affected the amount of CeO2 associated with roots (pure >
   FA > GA) but did not affect the translocation factor. Additionally, we
   could confirm via TEM and SEM that CeO2-NP5 adhered strongly to root
   surfaces of both plant species. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Colloids play an important role in governing the transport of
   radionuclides in geologic environments. As naturally occurring colloidal
   suspensions are compositionally heterogeneous, the subsurface fate of
   radionuclides may be sensitive to interactions among different kinds of
   colloids. Therefore, we investigated the adsorption equilibrium and
   desorption kinetics of uranium (U(VI)) in experiments conducted with
   compositionally homogeneous suspensions of colloidal SiO2, ZnO, hydrous
   ferric oxide (HFO) or humic acids (HAs) as well as heterogeneous
   suspensions consisting of a colloidal metal oxide and HA. We found that
   interactions between HAs and ZnO or HFO greatly inhibited the sorption
   of U onto colloids in the heterogeneous suspensions. HA-ZnO interactions
   enhanced the desorption of U from the heterogeneous colloidal
   suspensions, while the association between HA and SiO2 or HFO inhibited
   U desorption. Molecular-level characterizations reveal that HFO
   interacted with HAs by electrostatic interactions, association with
   aliphatic/aromatic carbon and inner-sphere complexation with carboxyl
   functional groups, while SiO2 and ZnO mainly associated with HAs by weak
   interactions (e.g., van der Waals interactions). The present findings
   indicate that interactions between HA and metal-oxide colloids can
   substantially influence the desorption of U(VI) from these particles,
   thereby potentially affecting the mobility of this radionuclide in
   groundwater.

AB A clear understanding of the factors controlling the deposition behavior
   of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs), such as quantum dots (QDs), is
   necessary for predicting their transport and fate in natural subsurface
   environments and in water filtration processes. A quartz crystal
   microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) was used to study the
   effect of particle surface coatings and water chemistry on the
   deposition of commercial QDs onto Al2O3. Two carboxylated QDs (CdSe and
   CdTe) with different surface coatings were compared with two model
   nanoparticles: sulfate-functionalized (sPL) and carboxyl-modified (cPL)
   polystyrene latex. Deposition rates were assessed over a range of ionic
   strengths (IS) in simple electrolyte (KCl) and in electrolyte
   supplemented with two organic molecules found in natural waters; namely,
   humic acid and rhamnolipid. The Al2O3 collector used here is selected to
   be representative of oxide patches found on the surface of aquifer or
   filter grains. Deposition studies showed that ENP deposition rates on
   bare Al2O3 generally decreased with increasing salt concentration, with
   the exception of the polyacrylic-acid (PAA) coated CdTe QD which
   exhibited unique deposition behavior due to changes in the conformation
   of the PAA coating. QD deposition rates on bare Al2O3 were approximately
   1 order of magnitude lower than those of the polystyrene latex
   nanoparticles, likely as a result of steric stabilization imparted by
   the QD surface coatings. Adsorption of humic acid or rhamnolipid on the
   Al2O3 surface resulted in charge reversal of the collector and
   subsequent reduction in the deposition rates of all ENPs. Moreover, the
   ratio of the two QCM-D output parameters, frequency and dissipation,
   revealed key structural information of the ENP-collector interface;
   namely, on bare Al2O3, the latex particles were rigidly attached as
   compared to the more loosely attached QDs. This study emphasizes the
   importance of considering the nature of ENP coatings as well as organic
   molecule adsorption onto particle and collector surfaces to avoid
   underestimating ENP mobility in natural and engineered aquatic
   environments.

AB Microbial selenium (Se) bioremediation is based on conversion of water
   soluble, toxic Se oxyanions to water insoluble, elemental Se. Formed
   biogenic elemental Se is of nanometer size, hampering straightforward
   separation from the aqueous phase. This study represents the first
   systematic investigation on colloidal properties of pure biogenic Se
   suspensions, linking electrophoretic mobility (potential) to column
   settling behavior. It was demonstrated that circumneutral pH, commonly
   applied in bioremediation, is not appropriate for gravitational
   separation due to the negative c-potential preventing agglomeration.
   Mono/di/trivalent counter cations and acidity (protons) were used to
   screen efficiently the intrinsic negative charge of biogenic Se
   suspensions at circumneutral pH. Fast settling was induced by La3+
   addition in the micromolar range (86.2 +/- 3.5% within 0.5 h), whereas
   considerably higher concentrations were needed when Ca2+ or Na+ was
   used. Colloidal stability was furthermore studied in different model
   waters. It was demonstrated that surface waters as such represent a
   fragile system regarding colloidal stability of biogenic Se suspensions
   (zeta-potential similar to -30 mV), whereas dissolved organic matter
   increases colloidal stability. In marine waters, biogenic Se is
   colloidally destabilized and is thus expected to settle, representing a
   potential sink for Se during transport in the aquatic environment.

AB As engineered nanoparticles (NPs) are increasingly used, their entry
   into the environment has become an important topic for water
   sustainability. Recent investigations point to the critical role of
   natural organic matter (NOM) in altering the persistence of NPs by
   complexing with their surfaces. The NP-NOM complex, in turn, is the new
   entity that may potentially influence subsequent fate of NPs. To
   understand the relative impact of humic (HA) and fulvic fraction of NOM
   on the stability and mobility of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), a
   combination of dynamic light scattering and quartz crystal
   microgravimetry with dissipation monitoring was used. In the absence of
   unbound NOM, (1) surface modification on either AgNP or silica substrate
   by different NOM fractions could lead to substantial changes in the
   extent and kinetics of AgNP aggregation and deposition, and (2) HA has a
   greater capability to enhance the transport of AgNPs by reducing their
   aggregation and deposition. With unbound NOM, HA seems to compete more
   successfully for binding sites on the substrate under electrostatically
   favorable conditions and formed a steric layer to prevent subsequent
   deposition of AgNPs. These findings highlighted the importance of NOM
   fraction in the overall environmental partitioning of AgNPs.

AB In aquatic systems, fulvic acids (FAs) are expected to play key roles on
   the stability and aggregation behavior of manufactured nanoparticles
   (NPs). The exact conditions under which aggregation or dispersion occurs
   will depend on the nanoparticle surface charge properties, FAs
   concentration as well as solution conditions, such as pH and ionic
   strength. The systematic calculation of stability (aggregation versus
   disaggregation) diagrams is therefore a key aspect in the prediction of
   the environmental fate and behavior of manufactured nanoparticles in
   aquatic systems. In this study, the responses to changes in pH and FAs
   concentrations on the resulting surface charge of purified iron oxide
   nanoparticles (53 nm nominal diameter) is investigated. By adjusting the
   pH, different nanoparticle surface charge electrostatic regions are
   found, corresponding to positively, neutral, and negatively charged
   nanoparticle solutions. For each situation, the adsorption of negatively
   charged FAs at variable concentrations is considered by analyzing
   surface charge modifications and calculating experimental kinetics
   aggregation rates. Results show that, under the conditions used, and
   range of FAs environmental relevant conditions, the nanoparticle
   aggregation process is promoted only when the nanoparticle positive
   surface charge (solution pH less than the charge neutralization point)
   is compensated by the adsorption of FAs. In all the other cases, FAs
   adsorption and increase of FAs concentration are expected to promote not
   only the NPs stabilization but also the disaggregation of NPs
   aggregates. In addition, our study suggest that very low concentrations
   of FAs >0.1 mg/l are sufficient to rapidly stabilize iron hydroxide NPs
   solutions at concentration <5 mg/l.

   environmentally relevant conditions (temperature, pH, and UV light).
   Increase in temperature (24-90 degrees C) and pH (6.1-9.0) of
   Ag+-Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) solutions accelerated the
   appearance of the characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of
   AgNPs. The rate of AgNP formation via reduction of Ag+ in the presence
   of different FM (SRFA, Pahokee Peat fulvic acid, PPFA, Nordic lake
   fulvic acid, NLFA) and Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) followed the
   order NLFA > SRHA > PPFA > SRFA. This order was found to be related to
   the free radical content of the acids, which was consistent with the
   proposed mechanism. The same order of AgNP growth was seen upon UV light
   illumination of Ag+-FA and Ag+-HA mixtures in moderately hard
   reconstituted water (MHRW). Stability studies of AgNPs, formed from the
   interactions of Ag+-SRFA, over a period of several months showed that
   these AgNPs were highly stable with SPR peak reductions of only similar
   to 15%. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light
   scattering (DLS) measurements revealed bimodal particle size
   distributions of aged AgNPs. The stable AgNPs formed through the
   reduction of Ag+ by fulvic and humic acid fractions of natural organic
   matter in the environment may be transported over significant distances
   and might also influence the overall bioavailability and ecotoxicity of
   AgNPs.

AB Emerging nanomaterials are being manufactured with varying particle
   sizes, morphologies, and crystal structures in the pursuit of achieving
   outstanding functional properties. These variations in these key
   material properties of nanoparticles may affect their environmental fate
   and transport. To date, few studies have investigated this important
   aspect of nanoparticles' environmental behavior. In this study, the
   aggregation kinetics of ten different TiO2 nanoparticles (5 anatase and
   5 rutile each with varying size) was systematically evaluated. Our
   results show that, as particle size increases, the surface charge of
   both anatase and rutile TiO2 nanoparticles shifts toward a more negative
   value, and, accordingly, the point of zero charge shifts toward a lower
   value. The colloidal stability of anatase sphere samples agreed well
   with DLVO theoretical predictions, where an increase in particle size
   led to a higher energy barrier and therefore greater critical
   coagulation concentration. In contrast, the critical coagulation
   concentration of rutile rod samples correlated positively with the
   specific surface area, i.e., samples with higher specific surface area
   exhibited higher stability. Finally, due to the large innate negative
   surface charge of all the TiO2 samples at the pH value (pHâ€Š=â€Š8) tested,
   the addition of natural organic matter was observed to have minimal
   effect on TiO2 aggregation kinetics, except for the smallest rutile rods
   that showed decreased stability in the presence of natural organic
   matter.

AB To enhance colloidal stability of nano zero-valent iron (NZVI) used for
   groundwater remediation, the surfaces of such NZVI can be modified via
   coating with organic stabilizers. These surface stabilizers can
   electrostatically, sterically, or electrosterically stabilize NZVI
   suspensions in water, but their efficacy is affected by the presence of
   humic acid (HA) in groundwater. In this study, the effect of HA on the
   colloidal stability of NZVI coated with three types of stabilizers
   (i.e., polyacrylic acid (PAA), Tween-20 and starch) was evaluated.
   Differing stability behaviors were observed for different
   surface-modified NZVIs (SM-NZVI) in the presence of HA. Fluorescence
   spectroscopic analysis probed the possible interactions at the
   SM-NZVI-HA interface, providing a better understanding of the effect of
   HA on SM-NZVI stability. The adsorption of HA on the surface of
   PAA-modified NZVI via complexation with NZVI (rather than the PAA
   stabilizer) enhanced the electrosteric repulsion effect, increasing the
   stability of the particles. However, for NZVI modified with Tween-20 or
   starch, HA could interact with the surface stabilizer and apparently
   play a "bridge" role among the particles, which might induce aggregation
   of the particles. Therefore, the stability behavior of NZVI modified
   with Tween-20 or starch might have resulted from the combined effect of
   "bridging" and "electrosteric" exerted by HA. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

   the stability of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-TiO2) in an

   that the particle size of nano-TiO2 was not sensitive to pH value but
   was inversely proportional to zeta potential. The nano-TiO2 becomes more
   stable with surface zeta potential, accompanied by small particle size
   and high dispersion. In the presence of DOM, the particle size was
   smaller and the stability of nano-TiO2 could be enhanced. This might be
   a synergistic effect of the ligand exchange and electrostatic force.
   Particle size increased with the addition of Ca2+ and the stability
   decreased.

   polymerisation using an ionic (sodium dodecyl sulphate; SDS) and a
   non-ionic stabiliser (Lutensol AT50). The most hydrophobic PNPs formed
   stable dispersions in deionised water, with the most hydrophilic
   aggregating immediately. All PNPs synthesised using SDS rapidly
   aggregated under mildly saline conditions whilst those synthesised using
   Lutensol AT50 were unaffected effected by salinity. The rate of PNP
   aggregation under saline conditions increased with increasing PNP
   concentration. Natural DOM in lake water did not influence the
   aggregation behaviour of the PNPs except at high PNP concentrations (500
   mg/L). The results show that salinity, PNP particle chemistry, PNP
   concentration and the type of stabilising agent used in synthesis can
   strongly influence their behaviour in aquatic environments, whilst DOM
   concentration is less significant.

AB The use of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) for in situ remediation of
   a wide scale of environmental pollutants is increasing. Bench and field
   pilot studies have recorded successful cleanup of many pollutants using
   nZVI and other iron-mediated nanoparticles. However, a major question
   remains unanswered: what is the long-term environmental fate of the iron
   nanoparticles used for remediation? We aged three types of commercial
   nZVI in different aqueous media, including a groundwater sample, under
   aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 28 days, and found that the bulk of
   the nZVI injected into polluted sites will end up in the sediment phase
   of the aquifer. This is mainly due to aggregation-induced sedimentation
   of the nZVI and the insoluble iron oxides formed when nZVI undergoes
   corrosion. Iron concentrations >500 g/kg were detected in sediment, a
   loading level of iron that may potentially affect some organisms and
   also reduce the permeability of aquifers. Dissolved and suspended iron
   concentrations initially surged when nZVI was applied, but iron
   decreased steadily in the supernatant and suspended sediment as the bulk
   of the iron partitioned into the sediment. Solution and surface
   chemistry of the iron species showed that nZVI remains reactive for more
   than 1 month, and that the reactivity of iron and its transformations
   are governed by environmental factors, including the presence of
   different ions, ionic strength, natural organic matter, and pH.

AB The increasing use of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) in industrial and
   household applications has led to their release into the environment and
   increasing concern about their effects. Proper assessment of the
   ecological risks of ENPs will require data on their bioavailability,
   persistence and mobility over a broad range of physicochemical
   conditions, including environmentally relevant pH, ionic strength and
   concentrations of natural organic matter (NOM). In this study,
   fluorescence correlation spectroscopy was used to determine the
   agglomeration of a ZnO ENP (nZnO) with a nominal size of 20 nm. Particle
   dissolution was followed using scanned stripping chronopotentiometry.
   The effects of Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA, 0-60 mg L-1) and the
   roles of pH (4-10) and ionic strength (0.005-0.1 M) were carefully
   evaluated. Agglomeration of the bare nZnO increased for pH values near
   the zero point of charge, whereas the dissolution of the particles
   decreased. At any given pH, an increase in ionic strength generally
   resulted in a less stable colloidal system. The role of SRFA was highly
   dependent upon its concentration with increased agglomeration observed
   at low SRFA : nZnO mass ratios and decreased agglomeration observed at
   higher SRFA : nZnO mass ratios. The results indicated that in natural
   systems, both nZnO dispersion and dissolution will be important and
   highly dependent upon the precise conditions of pH and ionic strength.

AB Zeta potential distributions of model waters containing silica, humic
   acid, and differing ionic composition were evaluated. These
   distributions showed that under high ionic strength and in the presence
   of divalent cations, positive colloids exist in suspension with neutral
   and negative colloids. Positive colloids do not form at lower ionic
   strength or when polyvalent cations are absent. The existence of the
   positive colloids in suspension with the negative colloids suggests
   that, while electrodynamically unstable, some stabilizing factor is
   preventing coagulation. This stabilizing factor is likely adsorbed humic
   acid causing steric hindrance. Further tests indicated that under the
   conditions that lead to the existence of positive colloids, removal of
   humic acid by ferric chloride coagulation is diminished as compared to
   coagulation in lower ionic strength water or water containing just
   sodium chloride as the ionic matrix. As positively calcium-humic
   complexes can increase fouling of desalting membranes through the
   formation of densely packed fouling layers, understanding the mechanisms
   of coagulation in high ionic strength waters is crucial to improving
   performance of desalination operations.

AB The influence of water temperature on the aggregation and dissolution
   kinetics of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) (mean diameter similar to
   40 nm) was investigated. Samples of 100 mg.L-1 ZnO NPs were incubated at
   15, 25 and 35 degrees C, similar to the surface temperature of cold
   freshwater, temperate estuarine, and tropical/sub-tropical coastal
   marine ecosystems, respectively. The natural organic matter (NOM)
   content, pH, electrolyte type, and ionic strength (IS), were adjusted on
   the basis of the water chemistries of typical aqueous systems.
   Specifically, the time-dependent hydrodynamic diameters (HDDs) and
   sedimentation plots were obtained over the first 3 h and after 24 h
   using time-resolved dynamic light scattering (TR-DLS) and UV-visible
   spectroscopy, respectively. The settling distance was further modeled
   for the aggregates with various HDDs according to the Stokes'
   sedimentation equation. The dissolution kinetics was studied over the
   first 12 h and after 48 h in term of percentage of released zinc ions.
   The results showed that the HDD increased at elevated temperatures,
   termed as temperature-induced aggregation, while dissolution was
   reduced. The aggregation at higher temperatures further hindered the
   dissolution due to the decrease in the surface area of the NPs. We
   express this process as "aggregate-suppressed dissolution". The maximum
   aggregation was reached in the tropical coastal marine environment with
   the HDD >3 mu m, and the released zinc ion of 9.2% was obtained in the
   cold freshwater. Based on the results, the aggregation rate of 1.57
   nm.s(-1) was estimated for the former, and the dissolution rate of 7.44
   x 10(-5) mol.L-1. h(-1) was calculated for the latter, respectively. The
   predicted values successfully fitted to genuine water samples (<26%
   deviation). This study provides useful data for environmental risk
   assessment of exposure of ZnO NPs to water column and benthic organisms.

AB A systematic investigation was conducted to understand the role of
   aquatic conditions on the aggregate morphology of nano-TiO2, and the
   subsequent impact on their fate in the environment. In this study, three
   distinctly sized TiO2 nanoparticles (6, 13, and 23 nm) that had been
   synthesized with flame spray pyrolysis were employed. Nanoparticle
   aggregate morphology was measured using static light scattering (SLS)
   over a wide range of solution chemistry, and in the presence of natural
   organic matter (NOM). Results showed that primary nanoparticle size can
   significantly affect the fractal dimension of stable aggregates. A
   linear relationship was observed between surface areas of primary
   nanoparticles and fractal dimension indicating that smaller primary
   nanoparticles can form more compact aggregate in the aquatic
   environment. The pH, ionic strength, and ion valence also influenced the
   aggregate morphology of TNPs. Increased pH resulted a decrease in
   fractal dimension, whereas higher ionic strength resulted increased
   fractal dimension particularly for monovalent ions. When NOM was
   present, aggregate fractal dimension was also affected, which was also
   notably dependent on solution chemistry. Fractal dimension of aggregate
   increase for 6 nm system in the presence of NOM, whereas a drop in
   fractal dimension was observed for 13 nm and 23 nm aggregates. This
   effect was most profound for aggregates comprised of the smallest
   primary particles suggesting that interactions of NOM with smaller
   primary nanoparticles are more significant than those with larger ones.
   The findings from this study will be helpful for the prediction of
   nanoparticle aggregate fate in the aquatic environment.

AB In this work, we demonstrate efficiency of the usage of synthetic humic
   substances (HSs) as reducing and stabilizing agent in preparation of
   silver nanoparticles for the first time. Preference of synthetic HSs
   over natural HSs is determined by a standardization problem resolution
   due to the strict control of conditions of the HS formation that expands
   the areas of application of the silver nanoparticles made on their
   basis. The formation of silver nanoparticles is confirmed by the UV-vis
   spectroscopy. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). The potentiometric and spectrophotometric data of
   kinetic study of the silver nanoparticles formation are reported. On the
   basis of various observations, a three-stage of silver nanoparticles
   formation is proposed: a fast formation of the Ag2O microphase in system
   after mixing of reagents: reduction of silver ions on the surface of
   Ag2O particles according to the zero-order kinetics: growth of silver
   nanoparticles due to reduction of silver ions from a solution on a

   to the first order kinetics after the Ag2O microphase dissolution. (C)

AB Motivated by the need to understand environmental risks posed by
   potentially biocidal engineered nanoparticles, the effects of silver
   nanoparticle (AgNP) exposure on viability in single species Pseudomonas
   fluorescens biofilms were determined via dye staining methods. AgNP
   dispersions, containing both particles and dissolved silver originating
   from the particles, negatively impacted biofilm viability in a
   dose-dependent manner. No silver treatments (up to 100 ppm AgNPs)
   resulted in 100% biofilm viability loss, even though these same
   concentrations caused complete viability loss in planktonic culture,
   suggesting some biofilm tolerance to AgNP toxicity. Colloidally stable
   AgNP suspensions exhibited greater toxicity to biofilms than
   corresponding particle-free supernatants containing only dissolved
   silver released from the particles. This distinct nanoparticle-specific
   toxicity was not observed for less stable, highly aggregated particles,
   suggesting that biofilms were protected against nanoparticle aggregate
   toxicity. In both the stable and highly aggregated dispersions,
   dissolved silver made a significant contribution to overall toxicity.
   Therefore, despite increased colloidal stability when humic acid
   adsorbed to AgNPs, the presence of humic acid mitigated the toxicity of
   AgNP suspensions because it bound to silver ions in solution.

AB The significance of natural organic matter (NOM, both humic acid and
   alginate) on the transport and deposition kinetics of ZnO nanoparticles
   (NPs) in irregular quartz sand was examined by direct comparison of both
   breakthrough curves and retained profiles with NOM present in NPs
   suspension versus those obtained without NOM. Packed column experiments
   were conducted in both NaCl and CaCl2 solutions under, a series of
   environmentally relevant ionic strengths. Under all examined conditions,
   breakthrough plateaus with NOM even at concentration as low as 1 mg L-1
   of total organic carbon (TOC) were higher than those without NOM,
   indicating that presence of NOM in NPs suspensions enhanced ZnO NPs
   transport. Although hyper-exponential retained profiles were observed
   both in the presence and absence of NOM, the amount of retained ZnO NPs
   acquired in the presence of NOM decreased slowly as the transport
   distance increased. Straining induced by concurrent aggregation is found
   to cause the hyper-exponential decrease. In the presence of NOM,
   electrosteric interaction effectively reduced the ZnO NPs deposition on
   collector surfaces and NPs-NPs aggregation. Subsequently, the amount of
   NPs that jammed in the column inlet in the absence of NOM were markedly
   decreased, which therefore exhibited as flatter retained profiles. (C)

AB Adsorption of natural organic matter (NOM) on nanoparticles can have
   dramatic impacts on particle dispersion resulting in altered fate and
   transport as well as bioavailability and toxicity. In this study, the
   adsorption of Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) on silver nanoparticles
   (nano-Ag) was determined and showed a Langmuir adsorption at pH 7 with
   an adsorption maximum of 28.6 mg g(-1) nano-Ag. It was also revealed
   that addition of <10 mg L-1 total organic carbon (TOC) increased the
   total Ag content suspended in the aquatic system, likely due to
   increased dispersion. Total silver content decreased with concentrations
   of NOM greater than 10 mg TOC L-1 indicating an increase in nanoparticle
   agglomeration and settling above this concentration. However, SRHA did
   not have any significant effect on the equilibrium concentration of
   ionic Ag dissolved in solution. Exposure of Daphnia to nano-Ag particles
   (50 mu g L-1 and pH 7) produced a linear decrease in toxicity with
   increasing NOM. These results clearly indicate the importance of water
   chemistry on the fate and toxicity of nanoparticulates. (C) 2012

AB There is an increasing concern that a considerable fraction of
   engineered nanoparticles (ENs), including quantum dots (QDs), will
   eventually find their way into the marine environment and have negative
   impacts on plankton. As ENs enter the ocean, they will encounter
   extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from microbial sources before
   directly interacting with plankton cells. In this study, EPS harvested
   from four phytoplankton species, Amphora sp., Dunaliella tertiolecta,
   Phaeocystis globosa, and Thalassiosira pseudonana, were examined for
   potential interactions with CdSe nonfunctionalized and functionalized
   (carboxyl- and amine-) QDs in artificial seawater. Our results show that
   EPS do not reduce the solubility of QDs but rather decrease their
   stability. The degradation rate of QDs was positively correlated to the
   protein composition of EPS (defined by the ratio of
   protein/carbohydrate). Two approaches showed significant inhibition to
   the degradation of carboxyl-functionalized QDs: (1) the presence of an
   antioxidant, such as N-acetyl cysteine, and (2) absence of light. Owing
   to the complexity in evaluating integrated effects of QDs intrinsic
   properties and the external environmental factors that control the
   stability of QDs, conclusions must be based on a careful consideration
   of all these factors when attempting to evaluate the bioavailability of
   QDs and other ENs in the marine environments.

AB Nanoparticle exposure in toxicity studies requires that nanoparticles
   are bioavailable by remaining highly dispersed in culture media.
   However, reported dispersion approaches are variable, mostly
   study-specific, and not transferable owing to their empirical basis.
   Furthermore, many published approaches employ proteinaceous dispersants
   in rich laboratory media, both of which represent end members in
   environmental scenarios. Here, a systematic approach was developed to
   disperse initially agglomerated TiO2 nanoparticles (Aeroxide (R) TiO2
   P25, Evonik, NJ; primary particle size range 6.4-73.8 nm) in
   oligotrophic culture medium for environmentally relevant bacterial
   toxicity studies. Based on understanding particle-particle interactions
   in aqueous media and maintaining environmental relevance, the approach
   involves (1) quantifying the relationship between pH and zeta potential
   to determine the point of zero charge of select nanoparticles in water;
   (2) nominating, then testing and selecting, environmentally relevant
   stabilizing agents; and (3) dispersing via "condition and capture"
   whereby stock dry powder nanoparticles are sonicated in pre-conditioned
   (with base, or acid, plus stabilizing agent) water, then diluted into
   culture media. The "condition and capture" principle is transferable to
   other nanoparticle and media chemistries: simultaneously, mechanically
   and electrostatically, nanoparticles can be dispersed with surrounding
   stabilizers that coat and sterically hinder reagglomeration in the
   culture medium.

AB Adsorption behaviors of fulvic acid (FA) and humic acid (HA) on
   kaolinite, smectite and vermiculite were investigated. To explore the
   adsorption mechanism, characterization of both the adsorption FA/HA-clay
   complexes and suspensions was conducted by utilizing multiple analytical
   techniques including liquid-state  1H nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy, high performance size exclusion chromatography, UV-vis
   spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy. Both FA and HA underwent fractionation
   during the adsorption due to different affinity for the functional
   moieties of FA/HA on the minerals. More HA was adsorbed than FA on
   kaolinite and smectite mainly via hydrophobic interaction. Electron
   transfer from aromatic units of FA to iron cation induced more FA than
   HA adsorbed onto vermiculite at higher FA/HA concentrations (>20mgC/L).
   Specific surface area and pore volume analyses indicated HA with larger
   particle size was prone to accumulate on the external mineral surfaces,
   while FA was easier than HA to block pores of the minerals. The
   increased pH in clay suspensions after FA/HA adsorption suggested that
   ligand exchange occurred and FA/HA-clay complexes formed, particularly
   for the 2:1 type minerals of smectite and vermiculite with the increase
   of pH at 0.41 and 0.62 units, respectively. Furthermore, the increase of
   the equilibrium pH or the decrease of the ionic strength led to the
   reduction of FA/HA adsorption on all the three minerals. Due to rich in
   iron cation, more carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups were
   facilitated for the ligand exchange and cation-bridging on vermiculite,
   and thus improved the adsorption capacity. The results of this study
   will improve our understanding of the roles of mineral interfacial
   properties, characteristics of FA and HA in the adsorption of FA/HA on
   clay minerals. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

   techniques including liquidstate H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy, high performance size exclusion chromatography, UV-vis
   spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy. Both FA and HA underwent fractionation
   during the adsorption due to different affinity for the functional
   moieties of FA/HA on the minerals. More HA was adsorbed than FA on
   kaolinite and smectite mainly via hydrophobic interaction. Electron
   transfer from aromatic units of FA to iron cation induced more FA than
   HA adsorbed onto vermiculite at higher FA/HA concentrations (>20 mg
   C/L). Specific surface area and pore volume analyses indicated HA with
   larger particle size was prone to accumulate on the external mineral
   surfaces, while FA was easier than HA to block pores of the minerals.
   The increased pH in clay suspensions after FA/HA adsorption suggested
   that ligand exchange occurred and FA/HA-clay complexes formed,
   particularly for the 2:1 type minerals of smectite and vermiculite with
   the increase of pH at 0.41 and 0.62 units, respectively. Furthermore,
   the increase of the equilibrium pH or the decrease of the ionic strength
   led to the reduction of FA/HA adsorption on all the three minerals. Due
   to rich in iron cation, more carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups
   were facilitated for the ligand exchange and cation-bridging on
   vermiculite, and thus improved the adsorption capacity. The results of
   this study will improve our understanding of the roles of mineral
   interfacial properties, characteristics of FA and HA in the adsorption
   of FA/HA on clay minerals. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To better understand their fate and toxicity in aquatic environments, we
   compared the aggregation and dissolution behavior of gum arabic (GA) and
   polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) coated Ag nanoparticles (NPs) in aquatic
   microcosms. There were four microcosm types: surface water; water and
   sediment; water and aquatic plants; or water, sediment, and aquatic
   plants. Dissolution and aggregation behavior of AgNPs were examined
   using ultracentrifugation, ultrafiltration, and asymmetrical flow field
   flow fractionation coupled to ultraviolet visible spectroscopy, dynamic
   and static laser light scattering, and inductively coupled plasma mass
   spectrometry. Plants released dissolved organic matter (DOM) into the
   water column either through active or passive processes in response to
   Ag exposure. This organic matter fraction readily bound Ag ions. The
   plant-derived DOM had the effect of stabilizing PVP-AgNPs as primary
   particles, but caused GA-AgNPs to be removed from the water column,
   likely by dissolution and binding of released Ag ions on sediment and
   plant surfaces. The destabilization of the GA-AgNPs also corresponded
   with X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy results which suggest that
   22-28% of the particulate Ag was associated with thiols and 5-14% was
   present as oxides. The results highlight the potential complexities of
   nanomaterial behavior in response to biotic and abiotic modifications in
   ecosystems, and may help to explain differences in toxicity of Ag
   observed in realistic exposure media compared to simplified laboratory
   exposures.

AB Copper nanomaterials are being used in a large number of commercial
   products because these materials exhibit unique optical, magnetic, and
   electronic properties. Metallic copper nanoparticles, which often have a
   thin surface oxide layer, can age in the ambient environment and become
   even more oxidized over time. These aged nanoparticles will then have
   different properties compared to the original nanoparticles. In this
   study, we have characterized three different types of copper-based
   nanoparticle (NP) samples designated as Cu(new) NPs, Cu(aged) NPs, and
   CuO NPs that differ in the level of oxidation. The solution phase
   behavior of these three copper-based nanoparticle samples is
   investigated as a function of pH and in the presence and absence of two
   common, complexing organic acids, citric and oxalic acid. The behavior
   of these three copper-based NP types shows interesting differences. In
   particular, Cu(aged) NPs exhibit unique chemistry including oxide phases
   that form and surface adsorption properties. Overall, the current study
   provides some insights into the impacts of nanoparticle aging and how
   the physicochemical characteristics and reactivity of nanomaterials can
   change upon aging.

AB The persistence of silver nanoparticles in aquatic environments and
   their subsequent impact on organisms depends on key transformation
   processes, which include aggregation, dissolution, and surface
   modifications by metal-complexing ligands. Here, we studied how
   cysteine, an amino acid representative of thiol ligands that bind
   monovalent silver, can alter the surface chemistry, aggregation, and
   dissolution of zero-valent silver nanoparticles. We compared
   nanoparticles synthesized with two coatings, citrate and
   polyvinylpirrolidone (PVP), and prepared nanoparticle suspensions
   (approximately 8 mu M total Ag) containing an excess of cysteine (400 mu
   M). Within 48 h, up to 47% of the silver had dissolved, as indicated by
   filtration of the samples with a 0.025-mu m filter. Initial dissolution
   rates were calculated from the increase of dissolved silver
   concentration when particles were exposed to cysteine and normalized to
   the available surface area of nanoparticles in solution. In general, the
   rates of dissolution were almost 3 times faster for citrate-coated
   nanoparticles relative to PVP-coated nanoparticles. Rates tended to be
   slower in solutions with higher ionic strength in which the
   nanoparticles were aggregating. Xray absorption spectroscopy analysis of
   the particles suggested that cysteine adsorbed to silver nanoparticles
   surfaces through the formation of Ag(+I)-sulfhydryl bonds. Overall, the
   results of this study highlight the importance of modifications by
   sulfhydryl-containing ligands that can drastically influence the
   long-term reactivity of silver nanoparticles in the aquatic environment
   and their bioavailability to exposed organisms. Our findings demonstrate
   the need to consider multiple interlinked transformation processes when
   assessing the bioavailability, environmental risks, and safety of
   nanoparticles, particularly in the presence of metal-binding ligands.

AB The distinct effects of humic acid (HA, 0-10 mg L-1) on the transport of
   titanium dioxide (rutile) nanoparticles (nTiO(2)) through saturated sand
   columns were observed under conditions of environmental relevance (ionic
   strength 3-200 mM NaCl, pH 5.7 and 9.0). Specifically, the transport of
   nTiO(2) was dramatically enhanced in the presence of HA at pH 5.7, even
   at a low HA concentration of 1 mg L-1. The mobility of nTiO(2) was
   further increased with greater concentrations of HA. In contrast, this
   enhancement of the nTiO(2) transportability due to the presence of HA
   was limited at pH 9.0 because of the negligible adsorption of HA onto
   nTiO(2), regardless of the concentrations of HA examined in this study.
   The distinct effects can be explained by the adsorption behaviors of HA
   to nTiO(2) and sand surfaces and the resulting interactions between
   nTiO(2) and sand surfaces under different conditions, which resulted in
   a large variation of the nTiO(2) transport and deposition behaviors at
   various conditions. In addition, theoretical interaction energy
   calculations and additional elution experiments indicate that the
   secondary energy minimum played an important role in controlling the
   nTiO(2) transport and deposition in porous media observed in this study.
   Moreover, the interaction energy calculations suggest that at pH 5.7, HA
   affected nTiO(2) transport by increasing the negative surface charge of
   nTiO(2) at low HA adsorption densities; whereas, combinations of
   increased electrostatic and steric interactions due to the presence of
   HA were the main mechanisms of enhanced transportability of nTiO(2) at
   high HA adsorption densities. Overall, results from this study suggest
   that natural organic matter and solution pH are likely key factors that
   govern the stability and mobility of nTiO(2), in the natural aquatic
   environment.

AB Modified humic acid (MHA) binder based on lignite humic substances is a
   novel sort of promising organic binder for iron ore pellets. Humic acid
   (HA) is one of the main ingredients of MHA binder. Pure HA was firstly
   isolated from lignite and then adsorption of HA onto magnetite particle
   surface was investigated. The final results indicate that the adsorption
   of HA onto magnetite surface accords with Langmuir model well, and it is
   evidently influenced by the initial HA concentration and solution pH
   value. Adsorption depends on chemical interaction at pH values above the
   PZC (the pH where the Zeta potentials of minerals are zero) of
   magnetite, while electrostatic attraction and chemical interaction both
   contribute to the adsorption at pH values below the PZC.

   the cit-AuNPs with respect to aggregation. However, specific effects
   varied among the different NOM isolates. At pH = 6 in 80 mM KCl, low
   concentrations (<0.25 mg C per L) of large molecular weight Suwannee
   River Humic Acid (SRHA) was required to stabilize cit-AuNPs, while
   larger concentrations (>2 mg C per L) of smaller Suwannee River Fulvic
   Acid (SRFA) were necessary at the same ionic strength. Suwannee River
   NOM (SRNOM) which contains both SRHA and SRFA behaved in a manner
   intermediate between the two. Pony Lake Fulvic Acid (PLFA), an
   autochthonous NOM isolate, provided substantial stability at low
   concentrations, yet aggregation was induced at NOM concentrations >2 mg
   C per L, a trend that is hypothesized to be the result of favourable
   hydrophobic interactions between coated particles induced at increased
   surface coverage. For all NOM isolates, it appears that NOM adsorption
   or conformational changes at the AuNP surfaces result in significant
   increases in the hydrodynamic diameter that aren't attributable to NP-NP
   aggregation.

   0749-0208.
   The effect of organic matter (OM) on the flocculation of colloidal
   montmorillonite was investigated through a complementary use of
   laboratory experiments and computational flocculation modeling. The
   model, based on Smoluchowski's coagulation model and population balance
   equation (PBE), was established with two key flocculation parameters:
   sticking efficiency and breakup parameter. The laboratory flocculation
   experiments tracked the temporal evolution of the mean floc sizes for
   aqueous systems with colloidal bare montmorillonite as well as those
   with montmorillonite and OM (humic acid, chitin, or xanthan gum). The
   key flocculation parameters were derived and calibrated through the
   interactive optimization of the model results by juxtaposing against the
   laboratory results.
   The calibrated flocculation parameter values revealed that OM has a
   complex influence on the flocculation behavior of montmorillonite. They
   also showed that the effect of OM on flocculation depends on the types
   of OM. For example, xanthan gum does not significantly modify the
   flocculation behavior of montmorillonite that is primarily determined by
   the electrical double-layer repulsion (i.e., zeta-potential) and van der
   Waals attraction [i.e., Derjaguin and Laudau, Verwey and Overbeek (DLVO)
   interaction energies], whereas chitin modifies both the sticking
   efficiency and breakup parameter.
   This study illustrates that there is no universally predictive
   correlation between DLVO energies or zeta-potential and flocculation
   parameters, as some OM has little effect on the DLVO interaction of
   montmorillonite colloids whereas other types of OM exert significant
   non-DLVO interactions such as repulsive hydration, steric repulsion, and
   polymer bridging. Further understanding of the physical-chemical
   properties of OM is needed in order to predict the flocculation
   behaviors of estuarine and coastal suspended colloids.

AB To characterize the environmental transport and quantify the risk of
   nanoparticles (NPs), it is important to fundamentally understand the
   aggregation of NPs and to describe this process quantitatively. This
   study investigates the aggregation kinetics of CeO2 NPs in the presence
   of KG, CaCl2 and humic acid (HA) using time-resolved dynamic light
   scattering. In KCl solutions, regardless of their concentration, HA
   drastically reduces the aggregation kinetics of CeO2 NPs. However, the
   effect of HA was more complicated in CaCl2 solutions. At low CaCl2
   concentrations, HA inhibited NP aggregation, whereas at high CaCl2
   concentrations, HA promoted aggregation. The critical coagulation
   concentration (CCC) in KCl in the absence of HA is approximately 36.5
   mM. In presence of both 1 ppm and 10 ppm HA in KCl solutions, extremely
   low aggregation kinetics were observed even at very high KCl
   concentrations (500 mM), implying KCl-CCCs in presence of HA were larger
   than 500 mM. The CCCs under conditions of no HA, 1 ppm HA and 10 ppm HA
   in CaCl2 solutions are approximately 9.5, 8.0 and 12.0 mM, respectively.
   These observations were analyzed in the framework of extended
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (EDLVO) theory. Moreover, a kinetic
   model was used to predict the aggregation kinetics of CeO2 NPs. The
   model predictions are in close agreement with experimental observations.
   To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to model
   quantitatively the aggregation of NPs in the presence of natural organic

AB Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (nHAP) have been widely used to remediate
   soil and wastewater contaminated with metals and radionuclides. However,
   our understanding of nHAP transport and fate is limited in natural
   environments that exhibit significant variability in solid and solution
   chemistry. The transport and retention kinetics of Alizarin red S
   (ARS)-labeled nHAP were investigated in water-saturated packed columns
   that encompassed a range of humic acid concentrations (HA, 0-10 mg L-1),
   fractional surface coverage of iron oxyhydroxide coatings on sand grains
   (lambda, 0-0.75), and pH (6.0-10.5). HA was found to have a marked
   effect on the electrokinetic properties of ARS-nHAP, and on the
   transport and retention of ARS-nHAP in granular media. The transport of
   ARS-nHAP was found to increase with increasing HA concentration because
   of enhanced colloidal stability and the reduced aggregate size. When HA
   = 10 mg L-1, greater ARS-nHAP attachment occurred with increasing 16
   lambda A because of increased electrostatic attraction between
   negatively charged nanoparticles and positively charged iron
   oxyhydroxides, although alkaline conditions (pH 8.0 and 10.5) reversed
   the surface charge of the iron oxyhydroxides and therefore decreased
   deposition. The retention profiles of ARS-nHAP exhibited a
   hyperexponential shape for all test conditions, suggesting some
   unfavorable attachment conditions. Retarded breakthrough curves occurred
   in sands with iron oxyhydroxide coatings because of time-dependent
   occupation of favorable deposition sites. Consideration of the above
   effects is necessary to improve remediation efficiency of nHAP for
   metals and actinides in soils and subsurface environments.

AB This study evaluated the effect of natural water composition onto the
   bactericidal and physicochemical properties of silver nanoparticles
   (AgNPs) stabilized with three different polymeric compounds.
   All the nanoparticles behaved similarly in the water conditions tested.
   Compared to solutions with low organic matter content and monovalent
   ions, lower disinfection performances of AgNPs suspensions were obtained
   in the following order seawater <= high organic matter content water <=
   high divalent cations content synthetic water. Suspension of AgNPs in
   seawater and water with divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) formed larger
   AgNPs aggregates (less than 1400 nm) compared to other solutions tested
   (up to approximately 38 nm). The critical coagulation concentration
   (CCC) of AgNPs was determined to quantitatively evaluate the stability
   of the nanoparticle suspension in different water conditions. When the
   concentration of dissolved organic matter was increased from 0 mg/L to 5
   mg/L, the CCC increased by a factor in the range of 2.19 +/- 0.25 for
   all AgNPs in divalent solutions, but a smaller increase occurred, in the
   range of 1.54 +/- 0.21 fold, when monovalent solutions were used.
   The concentration of ionic silver released indicated that the dissolved
   Ag+ (3.6-48.2 ppb) was less than 0.5% of the total mass of Ag-0 added.
   At all the conditions tested, the concentration of silver ions in
   solution had a negligible contribution to the overall anti-bacterial
   performance of AgNPs.
   This study demonstrated that the anti-bacterial performance of AgNPs at
   selected natural water conditions decreases in the presence of dissolved
   natural organic matter or divalent ions, such as humic acid and calcium
   carbonate. These results may be helpful in understanding the toxicity of
   AgNP in various natural water conditions and in explaining the risk

AB Adsorption of purified Aldrich humic acid (PAHA) onto alpha-Al2O3 is
   studied by batch experiments at different pH, ionic strength and
   coverage ratios R (mg of PAHA by m(2) of mineral surface). After
   equilibration, samples are centrifuged and the concentration of PAHA in
   the supernatants is measured. The amount of adsorbed PAHA per m(2) of
   mineral surface is decreasing with increasing pH. At constant pH value,
   the amount of adsorbed PAHA increases with initial PAHA concentration
   until a pH-dependent constant value is reached.
   UV/Visible specific parameters such as specific absorbance SUVA(254),
   ratio of absorbance values E-2/E-3 and width of the electron-transfer
   absorbance band Delta(ET) are calculated for supernatant PAHA fractions
   of adsorption experiments at pH 6.8, to have an insight on the evolution
   of PAHA characteristics with varying coverage ratio. No modification is
   observed compared to original compound for R not greater than or equal
   to 20 mg(PAHA)/g(alpha-Al2O3). Below this ratio, aromaticity decreases
   with initial PAHA concentration. Size-exclusion chromatography - organic
   carbon detection measurements on these supernatants also show a
   preferential adsorption of more aromatic and higher-sized fractions.
   Spectrophotometric titrations were done to estimate changes of
   reactivity of supernatants from adsorption experiments made at pH
   approximate to 6.8 and different PAHA concentrations. Evolutions of
   UV/Visible spectra with varying pH were treated to obtain titration
   curves that are interpreted within the NICA-Donnan framework.
   Protonation parameters of non-sorbed PAHA fractions are compared to
   those obtained for the PAHA before contact with the oxide. The amount of
   low proton-affinity type of sites and the value of their median affinity
   constant decrease after adsorption. From PAHA concentration in the
   supernatant and mass balance calculations, "titration curves" are
   experimentally proposed for the adsorbed fractions for the first time.
   These changes in reactivity to our opinion could explain the difficulty
   to model the behavior of ternary systems composed of
   pollutants/HS/mineral since additivity is not respected. (C) 2011

AB To gain important information on fate, mobility, and bioavailability of
   silver nanoparticles (AgNP) in aquatic systems, the influence of pH,
   ionic strength, and humic substances on the stability of
   carbonate-coated AgNP (average diameter 29 nm) was systematically
   investigated in 10 mM carbonate and 10 mM MOPS buffer, and in filtered
   natural freshwater. Changes in the physicochemical properties of AgNP
   were measured using nanoparticle tracking analysis, dynamic light
   scattering, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. According to the
   pH-dependent carbonate speciation, below pH 4 the negatively charged
   surface of AgNP became positive and increased agglomeration was
   observed. Electrolyte concentrations above 2 mM Ca2+ and 100 mM Na+
   enhanced AgNP agglomeration in the synthetic media. In the considered
   concentration range of humic substances, no relevant changes in the AgNP
   agglomeration state were measured. Agglomeration of AgNP exposed in
   filtered natural freshwater was observed to be primarily controlled by
   the electrolyte type and concentration. Moreover, agglomerated AgNP were
   still detected after 7 days of exposure. Consequently, slow
   sedimentation and high mobility of agglomerated AgNP could be expected
   under the considered natural conditions. A critical evaluation of the
   different methods used is presented as well.

AB The success of nanotechnology will undoubtedly lead to the increased
   introduction of nanoparticles (NPs) into natural systems, and aquatic
   systems will likely act as sinks for these new pollutants. Differences
   in the chemistry of these aquatic systems will control changes in
   surface properties of NPs and therefore could impact their environmental
   fate and toxicity. A series of batch experiments was conducted to
   determine the effect of natural waters with different solution
   chemistries on nanosilver (nAg) particle dispersion, stability, and
   toxicity. Toxicity assays were performed in tested natural waters as
   well as in traditional growth media. Briefly, nAg suspended in a natural
   water with a low ionic strength/dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ratio had
   an average particle size of 76.8 +/- 0.4nm and was less toxic to
   Ceriodaphnia dubia and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (median lethal
   concentration [LC50]=221ppb and median inhibition concentration
   [IC50]=1,600ppb, respectively), whereas a natural water with a high
   ionic strength/DOC ratio had an average particle size of 192 +/- 5.1nm
   and produced a much higher toxicity response (LC50=0.433ppb and
   IC50=22.6ppb, respectively). These findings help to establish needed
   correlations between water-matrix-dependent nAg particle properties and
   toxicity implications and indicate that the use of traditional growth
   media in toxicity assays concerning engineered NPs might not always be
   appropriate. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2012;31:168175. (C) 2011 SETAC

AB The aggregation/sedimentation potentials of TiO2 nanoparticles were
   studied in mono- and binary systems of Suwannee River fulvic acids
   (SRFA) and Fe(III) at different pH values. SRFA adsorption significantly
   enhanced the stability of TiO2 nanoparticles at pH 4, 6 and 8, mainly
   due to the dramatic increase in negative surface charges. The presence
   of Fe(III) stabilized aggregation/sedimentation of TiO2 nanoparticles at
   pH 4 due to the increasing positive charges after Fe(III) sorption, but
   destabilized aggregation/sedimentation at pH 6 and 8 attributed to the
   bridging effect of Fe(III)-hydroxy. The formation of COO-Fe(III) complex
   was found in binary system of SRFA and Fe(III). Thus, the positive
   charges that Fe(III) imparted to nanoparticles were neutralized by SRFA.
   Compared with those in mono-system of Fe(III). SRFA enhanced
   aggregation/sedimentation at pH 4, while stabilized TiO2 nanoparticles
   at higher pH in binary system of SRFA and Fe(III). The sedimentation
   rates of TiO2 nanoparticles showed relatively lower coefficient with
   zeta potentials (-0.883, P < 0.01) than with hydrodynamic particle sizes
   (0.964, P < 0.01), due to the steric hindrance of SRFA and the bridging
   effect of Fe(III)-hydroxy, which was confirmed by DLVO calculation.
   These results have important implications for prediction of the
   stability and fate of nanoparticles in natural water. (C) 2011 Elsevier

AB Engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) from industrial applications and
   consumer products are already being released into the environment. Their
   distribution within the environment is, among other factors, determined
   by the dispersion state and aggregation behavior of the nanoparticles
   and, in turn, directly affects the exposure of aquatic organisms to
   EPNs. The aggregation behavior (or colloidal stability) of these
   particles is controlled by the water chemistry and, to a large extent,
   by the surface chemistry of the particles. This paper presents results
   from extensive colloidal stability tests on commercially relevant
   titanium dioxide nanoparticles (Evonik P25) in well-controlled synthetic
   waters covering a wide range of pH values and water chemistries, and
   also in standard synthetic (EPA) waters and natural waters. The results
   demonstrate in detail the dependency of TiO(2) aggregation on the ionic
   strength of the solution, the presence of relevant monovalent and
   divalent ions, the presence and copresence of natural organic matter
   (NOM), and of course the pH of the solution. Specific interactions of
   both NOM and divalent ions with the TiO(2) surfaces modify the chemistry
   of these surfaces resulting in unexpected behavior. Results from matrix
   testing in well-controlled batch systems allow predictions to be made on
   the behavior in the broader natural environment. Our study provides the
   basis for a testing scheme and data treatment technique to extrapolate
   and eventually predict nanoparticle behavior in a wide variety of
   natural waters.

AB The interactions of engineered nanomaterials with natural organic matter
   (NOM) exert a profound influence on the mobilities of the former in the
   environment. However, the influence of specific nanomaterial structural
   characteristics on the partitioning and colloidal stabilization of
   engineered nanomaterials in various ecological compartments remains
   underexplored. Herein, we present a systematic study of the interactions
   of humic acid (HA, as a model for NOM) with monodisperse,
   well-characterized, ligand-passivated HfO2, ZrO2, and solid-solution
   HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles (NPs). We note that mixing with HA induces the
   almost complete phase transfer of hydrophobically coated monoclinic
   metal oxide (MO) NPs from hexane to water. Furthermore, HA is seen to
   impart appreciable colloidal stabilization to the NPs in the aqueous
   phase. In contrast, phase transfer and aqueous-phase colloidal
   stabilization has not been observed for tetragonal MO-NPs. A mechanistic
   model for the phase transfer and aqueous dispersal of MO-NPs is proposed
   on the basis of evidence from transmission electron microscopy,
   zeta-potential measurements, dynamic light scattering. Raman and
   infrared spectroscopies, elemental analysis, and systematic experiments
   on a closely related set of MO-NPs with varying composition and crystal
   structure. The data indicate the synergistic role of over-coating
   (micellar). ligand substitution (coordinative), and electrostatic
   processes wherein HA acts both as an amphiphilic molecule and a charged
   chelating ligand. The strong observed preference for the phase transfer
   of monoclinic instead of tetragonal NPs indicates the importance of the
   preferential binding of HA to specific crystallographic facets and
   suggests the possibility of being able to design NPs to minimize their
   mobilities in the aquatic environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The premise of the nanotechnology revolution is based on the increased
   surface reactivity of nanometer-sized particles. Thus, these newly
   realized applications of noble metal nanoparticles introduce new
   concerns about the environmental fate of these materials if released
   during use or product disposal. In this paper, the focus is on silver
   nanoparticles, a known biocidal agent. In particular, this work explores
   the effect of model solutes chosen for their simple chemical structure
   yet their ability to simulate chemical attributes common to soil humic
   material: a chelating molecule, EDTA; a nonionic surfactant. Brij 35;
   and a large polysaccharide, alginic acid. Batch systems containing
   concentrated (1600 mg L(-1)) silver nanoparticle (nAg) suspensions were
   equilibrated with varying additions of EDTA, Brij 35, or alginic acid to
   solutions containing 1 or 100 mM NaNO(3) background electrolyte. In
   general, both EDTA and alginate were shown to exhibit poor control over
   nAg dispersion stability, while Brij 35 served as a good dispersant of
   nAg particles, showing little difference in particle size with respect
   to electrolyte concentration. The data also show that loading of the
   model organic compounds resulted in the supersaturation of dissolved Ag
   for most of the systems. Mechanisms by which these occurred are
   discussed in more detail. The evidence suggests that regardless of the
   effect of humics on the stability of nAg dispersions in aqueous systems,
   polymer loading may enhance the dissolution and release of dissolved Ag
   into the environment. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The rapid development of nanotechnology and the related production and
   application of nanosized materials such as engineered nanoparticles
   (ENP) inevitably lead to the emission of these products into
   environmental systems. So far, little is known about the occurrence and
   the behaviour of ENP in environmental aquatic systems. In this
   contribution, the influence of natural organic matter (NOM) and ionic
   strength on the stability and the interactions of silver nanoparticles
   (n-Ag) in aqueous suspensions was investigated using UV-vis spectroscopy
   and asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF(4)) coupled with
   UV-vis detection and mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). n-Ag particles were
   synthesized by chemical reduction of AgNO(3) with NaBH(4) in the liquid
   phase at different NOM concentrations. It could be observed that the
   destabilization effect of increasing ionic strength on n-Ag suspensions
   was significantly decreased in the presence of NOM, leading to a more
   stable n-Ag particle suspension. The results indicate that this
   behaviour is due to the adsorption of NOM molecules onto the surface of
   n-Ag particles ("coating") and the resulting steric stabilization of the
   particle suspension. The application of AF(4) coupled with highly
   sensitive detectors turned out to be a powerful method to follow the
   aggregation of n-Ag particle suspensions at different physical-chemical
   conditions and to get meaningful information on their chemical
   composition and particle size distributions. The method described will
   also open the door to obtain reliable data on the occurrence and the
   behaviour of other ENP in environmental aquatic systems. (C) 2011

AB The colloidal behavior of natural organic matter (NOM) and synthetic
   poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)-coated ferrimagnetic (gamma Fe2O3)
   nanoparticles (NPs) was investigated. Humic acid (HA), an important
   component of NOM, was extracted from a peat soil. Two different
   molecular weight PAAs were also used for coating. The colloidal
   stability of the coated magnetic NPs was evaluated as a resultant of the
   attractive magnetic dipolar and van der Waals forces and the repulsive
   electrostatic and steric- electrosteric interactions. The conformational
   alterations of the polyelectrolytes adsorbed on magnetic gamma Fe2O3 NPs
   and their role in colloidal stability were determined. Pure gamma Fe2O3
   NPs were extremely unstable because of aggregation in aqueous solution,
   but a significant stability enhancement was observed after coating with
   polyelectrolytes. The steric stabilization factor induced by the
   polyelectrolyte coating strongly dictated the colloidal stability. The
   pH-induced conformational change of the adsorbed, weakly charged
   polyelectrolytes had a significant effect on the colloidal stability.
   Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed the stretched conformation of the
   HA molecular chains adsorbed on the gamma Fe2O3 NP surface at pH 9,
   which enhanced the colloidal stability through long-range electrosteric
   stabilization. The depletion of the polyelectrolyte during the dilution
   of the NP suspension decreased the colloidal stability under acidic
   solution conditions. The conformation of the polyelectrolytes adsorbed
   on the NP surface was altered as a function of the substrate surface
   charge as viewed from AFM imaging. The polyelectrolyte coating also led
   to a reduction in magnetic moments and decreased the coercivity of the
   coated gamma Fe2O3 NPs. Thus, the enhanced stabilization of the coated
   maghematite NPs may facilitate their delivery in the groundwater for the
   effective removal of contaminants.

AB The aggregation kinetics of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) that were
   coated with two commonly used capping agents-citrate and
   polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-were investigated. Time-resolved dynamic
   light scattering (DLS) was employed to measure the aggregation kinetics
   of the AgNPs over a range of monovalent and divalent electrolyte
   concentrations. The aggregation behavior of citrate-coated AgNPs in NaCl
   was in excellent agreement with the predictions based on
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, and the Hamaker constant
   of citrate-coated AgNPs in aqueous solutions was derived to be 3.7 x
   10(-20). Divalent electrolytes were more efficient in destabilizing the
   citrate-coated AgNPs, as indicated by the considerably lower critical
   coagulation concentrations (2.1 mM CaCl(2) and 2.7 mM MgCl(2) vs 47.6 mM
   NaCl). The PVP-coated AgNPs were significantly more stable than
   citrate-coated AgNPs in both NaCl and CaCl(2), which is likely due to
   steric repulsion imparted by the large, noncharged polymers. The
   addition of humic acid resulted in the adsorption of the macromolecules
   on both citrate- and PVP-coated AgNPs. The adsorption of humic acid
   induced additional electrosteric repulsion that elevated the stability
   of both nanoparticles in suspensions containing NaCl or low
   concentrations of CaCl(2). Conversely, enhanced aggregation occurred for
   both nanoparticles at high CaCl(2) concentrations due to interparticle
   bridging by humic acid aggregates.

AB Metal oxide nanoparticles are used in a wide range of commercial
   products, leading to an increased interest in the behavior of these
   materials in the aquatic environment. The current study focuses on the
   stability of some of the smallest ZnO nanomaterials, 4 +/- 1 nm in
   diameter nanoparticles, in aqueous solutions as a function of pH and
   ionic strength as well as upon the adsorption of humic acid.
   Measurements of nanoparticle aggregation due to attractive
   particle-particle interactions show that ionic strength, pH, and
   adsorption of humic acid affect the aggregation of ZnO nanoparticles in
   aqueous solutions, which are consistent with the trends expected from
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. Measurements of
   nanoparticle dissolution at both low and high pH show that zinc ions can
   be released into the aqueous phase and that humic acid under certain,
   but not all, conditions can increase Zn2+(aq) concentrations. Comparison
   of the dissolution of ZnO nanoparticles of different nanoparticle
   diameters, including those near IS and 240 nm, shows that the smallest
   nanoparticles dissolve more readily. Although qualitatively this
   enhancement in dissolution can be predicted by classical thermodynamics,
   quantitatively it does not describe the dissolution behavior very well.

   natural freshwaters and synthetic aquatic media. Ultraviolet-visible
   absorbance spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and atomic force
   microscopy were used to evaluate the colloidal stability of AgNPs in
   locally-obtained pond water, moderately hard reconstituted water alone
   or with natural organic matter (NOM), synthetic seawater, and also the
   individual chemicals most prevalent in seawater. Singly dispersed AgNPs
   in seawater and waters with greater than 20 mmol L(-1) sodium chloride
   were unstable, with the optical absorbance approaching zero within the
   first ten hours of mixing. Agglomeration rates as a function of water
   chemistry and NOM are tested as a hypothesis to explain the rates of
   disappearance of singly dispersed AgNPs. Other samples, mostly those
   with lower salinity or NOM, maintained varying degrees of colloidal

AB The aggregation kinetics of TiO(2) nanoparticles was studied in the
   absence and presence of Suwanee River humic acid (SRHA) in either NaCl
   or CaCl(2) electrolytes. The CCC[Ca(2+)]/CCC[Na(+)] ratios were found to
   yield a proportionality fraction of Z(-7.2) (in the absence of SRHA) and
   z(-5.6) (in the presence of SRHA), near the theoretical prediction of
   z(-6), where z is the cation's valence. SRHA drastically increased the
   stability of TiO(2) nanoparticles under most conditions, due to the
   combined effect of increased electrostatic and steric repulsions.
   Deposition rates of TiO(2) nanoparticles onto a silica surface were
   quantitatively measured using a quartz crystal microbalance with
   dissipation (QCM-D) over a broad range of solution (pH and ionic
   strength, IS) conditions, and the effects of the SRHA on particle
   deposition behavior were evaluated. In general, zeta potential can be
   used to predict the interaction energies between particles or particles
   and surfaces, and from there an inference can be made as to the
   potential for aggregation and deposition. The presence of SRHA
   significantly hinders TiO(2) deposition onto silica surfaces via steric
   repulsion in addition to repulsive electrostatics even under high ionic
   strength, which has important implications for the mobility of these
   nanoparticles. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We have studied the aggregation of model silica particles in the
   presence of NOMs (fulvic acid, humic acid, or alginate) by using dynamic
   light scattering. Experiments were performed systematically by changing
   CaCl(2) concentration, the types and concentration of NOMs: Suwannee
   river fulvic acid (SRFA), Suwannee river humic acid (SRHA), and
   alginate. Experimental results demonstrate that the aggregation rate in
   the presence of the SRFA and Ca(2+) ions was on par with the rate of the
   diffusion limited aggregation. On the other hand, the addition of SRHA
   or alginate extremely enhances the rate of aggregation in the presence
   of CaCl(2) compared to the rate of diffusion limited aggregation. The
   enhancement of the rate is probably due to the bridging of silica
   particles by the microgels formed by the Ca-mediated bridging of
   SRHA/alginate molecules. Also, the enhanced aggregation with
   alginates/SRHA and Ca(2+) ions is reduced by the coexistence of K(+) or
   Mg(2+) ions. We suppose that the breaking of Ca-mediated bridging of
   alginates/SRHA by ion-exchange reduces the rate of the enhanced
   aggregation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nanoparticulate metal sulfides such as ZnS can influence the transport
   and bioavailability of pollutant metals in anaerobic environments. The
   aim of this work was to investigate how the composition of dissolved
   natural organic matter (NOM) influences the stability of zinc sulfide
   nanoparticles as they nucleate and aggregate in water with dissolved
   NOM. We compared NOM fractions that were isolated from several surface
   waters and represented a range of characteristics including molecular
   weight, type of carbon, and ligand density. Dynamic light scattering was
   employed to monitor the growth and aggregation of Zn-S-NOM nanoparticles
   in supersaturated solutions containing dissolved aquatic humic
   substances. The NOM was observed to reduce particle growth rates,
   depending on solution variables such as type and concentration of NOM,
   monovalent electrolyte concentration, and pH. The rates of growth
   increased with increasing ionic strength, indicating that observed
   growth rates primarily represented aggregation of charged Zn-S-NOM
   particles. Furthermore, the observed rates decreased with increasing
   molecular weight and aromatic content of the NOM fractions, while
   carboxylate and reduced sulfur content had little effect. Differences
   between NOM were likely due to properties that increased electrosteric
   hindrances for aggregation. Overall, results of this study suggest that
   the composition and source of NOM are key factors that contribute to the
   stabilization and persistence of zinc, sulfide nanoparticles in the
   aquatic environment.

AB The adsorption of natural organic matter (NOM) to the surfaces of
   natural colloids and engineered nanoparticles is known to strongly
   influence, and in some cases control, their surface properties and
   aggregation behavior. As a result, the understanding of nanoparticle
   fate, transport, and toxicity in natural systems must include a
   fundamental framework for predicting such behavior. Using a suite of
   gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with different capping agents, the impact of
   surface functionality, presence of natural organic matter, and aqueous
   chemical composition (pH, ionic strength, and background electrolytes)
   on the surface charge and colloidal stability of each AuNP type was
   investigated. Capping agents used in this study were as follows: anionic
   (citrate and tannic acid), neutral
   (2,2,2-[mercaptoethoxy(ethoxy)]ethanol and polyvinylpyrrolidone), and
   cationic (mercaptopentyl(trimethylammonium)). Each AuNP type appeared to
   adsorb Suwannee River Humic Acid (SRHA) as evidenced by measurable
   decreases in zeta potential in the presence of 5 mg C L-1 SRHA. It was
   found that 5 mg C L-1 SRHA provided a stabilizing effect at low ionic
   strength and in the presence of only monovalent ions while elevated
   concentrations of divalent cations lead to enhanced aggregation. The
   colloidal stability of the NPs in the absence of NOM is a function of
   capping agent, pH, ionic strength, and electrolyte valence. In the
   presence of NOM at the conditions examined in this study, the capping
   agent is a less important determinant of stability, and the adsorption
   of NOM is a controlling factor.

AB The increasing production and use of quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles have
   caused concerns on the possibility of contaminating the aquatic and
   terrestrial ecosystems with wastes that may contain QDs. Therefore,
   studies on the behavior of QDs upon interaction with components of the
   natural environment have become of interest. This study investigated the
   fluorescence and electrophoretic mobility of carboxylic or amine
   polyethylene glycol (PEG)-functionalized CdSe/ZnS QDs in the presence of
   two aquatic humic substances (HS), Suwannee River humic and fulvic
   acids, using capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence
   detection. Results showed initial enhancement in fluorescence of QDs at
   the onset of the interaction with HS, followed by fluorescence quenching
   at longer exposure with HS (>30 min). It was also observed that the
   electrophoretic mobility of QDs increases with increasing concentration
   of HS, suggesting an increase in the ratio in charge to hydrodynamic
   size of the nanoparticles. To determine if the QDs degraded upon
   interaction with HS, the QD-HS mixtures were dialyzed to separate free
   Cd2+ from intact QDs, followed by analysis of the solutions using
   inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Results suggested that
   degradation of QDs in the presence of HS did not occur within the period
   of incubation.

AB Although numerous studies have been conducted to discern colloid
   transport and stability processes, the mechanistic understanding of how
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) affects colloid fate in unsaturated soils
   (i.e., the vadose zone) remains unclear. This study aims to bridge the
   gap between the physicochemical responses of colloid complexes and
   porous media interfaces to solution chemistry, and the effect these
   changes have on colloid transport and fate. Measurements of adsorbed
   layer thickness, density, and charge of DOM-colloid complexes and
   transport experiments with tandem internal process visualization were
   conducted for key constituents of DOM, humic (HA) and fulvic acids (FA),
   at acidic, neutral and basic pH and two CaCl(2) concentrations.
   Polymeric characteristics reveal that, of the two tested DOM
   constituents, only HA electrosterically stabilizes colloids. This
   stabilization is highly dependent on solution pH which controls DOM
   polymer adsorption affinity, and on the presence of Ca(+2) which
   promotes charge neutralization and inter-particle bridging. Transport
   experiments indicate that HA improved colloid transport significantly,
   while FA only marginally affected transport despite having a large
   effect on particle charge. A transport model with deposition and
   pore-exclusion parameters fit experimental breakthrough curves well.
   Trends in deposition coefficients are correlated to the changes in
   colloid surface potential for bare colloids, but must include adsorbed
   layer thickness and density for sterically stabilized colloids.
   Additionally, internal process observations with bright field microscopy
   reveal that, under optimal conditions for retention, experiments with FA
   or no DOM promoted colloid retention at solid-water interfaces, while
   experiments with HA enhanced colloid retention at air-water interfaces,
   presumably due to partitioning of HA at the air-water interface and/or
   increased hydrophobic characteristics of HA-colloid complexes. (C) 2010

AB Silicon nanoparticles (NPs) have potential applications in many fields
   including microelectronics, biomedical imaging, and most recently
   energetics. Even though silicon NPs are thought to be harmless, their
   full impact on the environment and human health needs further
   investigation due to their potential increased use and recent toxicity
   data. Various techniques were used to characterize silicon NPs that are
   being considered for use in energetics. These techniques included
   dynamic light scattering (DLS), electron microscopy (EM), X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Experiments were
   also conducted on the early stage aggregation kinetics of silicon NPs in
   the presence of Ca2+ and Suwannee River Humic Acid (SRHA). The addition
   of SRHA in the presence of Ca2+ resulted in increased attachment
   efficiencies and decreased critical coagulation concentration (from 0.4
   to 0.1 M). The enhanced aggregation was attributed to bridging generated
   by SRHA aggregates as evidenced by selected area electron diffraction
   (SAED) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). SAED verified the
   bridging to be amorphous phase comprised of humic substances rather than
   artifacts of silicon crystallites. Element distribution analyses were
   also used in the delineation of the silicon NP aggregation mechanisms in
   the absence and presence of SAHA. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Aging in water of a TiO2-based nanocomposite used in sunscreen cosmetics
   has been studied as a function of light and time. It consisted initially
   in a TiO2 core, coated with Al(OH)(3) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
   layers. Size measurement, coating alteration, and surface charge were
   followed by laser diffraction, TEM/EDS, ICP-AES and electrophoretic
   mobility measurement.
   The nanocomposite rapidly underwent progressive dispersion in the
   aqueous phase, enabled by the dissolution of the PDMS layer. A stable
   suspension of colloidal byproducts from 50 to 700 nm in size was formed.
   Their positively charged Al(OH)(3) surface was evidenced with an
   isoelectric point around 7-8, controlling the dispersion stability. The
   critical coagulation concentrations measured with NaCl and CaCl2 was 2 x
   10(-2) and 8 x 10(-3) M respectively. The presence of natural organic
   matter affected the colloidal stability according to the NOM/byproduct
   ratio. A 2 wt% ratio favored bridging flocculation, whereas a 20 wt%
   ratio induced sterical stabilization. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB A series of polyelectrolytes with controlled molecular weight, a narrow
   chain-length distribution, and systematic structural differences were
   synthesized using atom-transfer radical polymerization and investigated
   as stabilizers for magnetite nanoparticles in aqueous suspensions.
   Structural differences include the degree of polymerization, the chain
   architecture, and the identity of the charged functional unit. The
   synthesized polymers are sulfonated poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), a
   block copolymer of the former with poly(n-butyl methacrylate).
   poly(sodium styrene sulfonate), poly(sodium acrylate), and poly(sodium
   vinylphosphonate). The colloidal stability is assessed by measuring the
   fraction of particles, based on turbidity, that sediment alter a period
   or time at increasing ionic strength. Sedimentation results are
   complimented by dynamic light scattering determinations of the
   hydrodynamic diameter of the particles that remain suspended. When
   adsorption and sedimentation are conducted at high pH, poly(sodium
   acrylate) and poly(sodium vinylphosphonate) yield the most stable
   suspensions because of their strong coordinative interactions with the
   iron oxide surface. At tow pH, the polymers that retain pendant negative
   charges (each of the sulfonated polymers) yield high stable fractions at
   all ionic strengths investigated up to 100 mM (NaCl), whereas
   polyelectrolytes that become protonated with decreasing pH, poly(sodium
   acrylate) and poly(sodium vinylphosphonate). lose their stabilizing
   capacity even at low ionic strengths. The chain-length distribution
   profoundly alters a polymer's stabilization tendencies. Two poly(sodium
   acrylate) samples with the same number-average molecular weight hut
   widely different chain-length distributions proved to have opposite
   tendencies, with the polydisperse sample being a good stabilizer and the
   low polydispersity one being a strong flocculant. This investigation
   provides guidelines for the design or polymeric stabilizers for
   magnetite nanoparticles according to the pH and ionic strength of the
   intended application.

AB The ecological risk assessment of chemicals including nanoparticles is
   based on the determination of adverse effects on organisms and on the
   environmental concentrations to which biota are exposed. The aim of this
   work was to better understand the behavior of nanoparticles in the
   environment, with the ultimate goal of predicting future exposure
   concentrations in water. We measured the concentrations and particle
   size distributions of CeO2 nanoparticles in algae growth medium and
   deionized water in the presence of various concentrations and two types
   of natural organic matter (NOM). The presence of natural organic matter
   stabilizes the CeO2 nanoparticles in suspension. In presence of NOM, up
   to 88% of the initially added CeO2 nanoparticles remained suspended in
   deionized water and 41% in algae growth medium after 12 d of settling.
   The adsorbed organic matter decreases the zeta potential from about -15
   mV to -55 mV. This reduces aggregation by increased electrostatic
   repulsion. The particle diameter, pH, electric conductivity and NOM
   content shows significant correlation with the fraction of CeO2
   nanoparticles remaining in suspension. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Mercury is a global contaminant of concern due to its transformation by
   microorganisms to form methylmercury, a toxic species that accumulates
   in biological tissues. The effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   isolated from natural waters on reactions between mercury(II) (Hg) and
   sulfide (S(-II)) to form HgS((s)) nanoparticles across a range of Hg and
   S(-II) concentrations was investigated. Hg was equilibrated with DOM,
   after which S(-II) was added. Dissolved Hg (Hg(aq)) was periodically
   quantified using ultracentrifugation and chemical analysis following the
   addition of S(-II). Particle size and identity were determined using
   dynamic light scattering and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. S(-II)
   reacts with Hg to form 20 to 200 nm aggregates consisting of 1-2 nm
   HgS((s)) subunits that are more structurally disordered than
   metacinnabar in the presence of 2 x 10(-9) to 8 x 10(-6) M Hg and 10 (mg
   C) L(-1) DOM. Some of the HgS((s)) nanoparticle aggregates are
   subsequently dissolved by DOM and (re)precipitated by S(-II) over
   periods of hours to clays. At least three fractions of Hg-DOM species
   were observed with respect to reactivity toward S(-II): 0.3 mu mol
   reactive Hg per mmol C (60 percent), 0.1 mu mol per mmol C (20 percent)
   that are kinetically hindered, and another 0.1 mu mol Ha per mmol C (20
   percent) that are inert to reaction with S(-II). Following an initial
   S(-II)-driven precipitation of HgS((s)), HgS((s)) was dissolved by DOM
   or organic sulfur compounds. HgS((s)) formation during this second phase
   was counterintuitively favored by lower S(-II) concentrations,
   suggesting surface association of DOM moieties that are less capable of
   dissolving HgS((s)). DOM partially inhibits HgS((s)) formation and
   mediates reactions between Hg and S(-II) such that HgS((s)) is
   susceptible to dissolution. These findings indicate that Hg
   accessibility to microorganisms could be controlled by kinetic
   (intermediate) species in the presence of S(-II) and DOM, undermining
   the premise that equilibrium Ha species distributions should correlate
   to the extent or rate of Hg methylation in soils and sediments.

AB Nano boron is a promising new propellant being considered for military
   and civilian applications; however, the impact of its release on the
   environment is largely not known. The early stage aggregation kinetics
   of boron nanoparticles was investigated in the presence of two kinds of
   natural organic matter Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) and sodium
   alginate by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). The addition of SRHA caused the boron nanoparticles to
   stabilize and resulted in (1) decreased attachment efficiency for the
   reaction-controlled regime and (2) an increase in the critical
   coagulation concentration, in CaCl(2) and MgCl(2) solutions. The
   increase in the electrostatic repulsion is suggested as a main cause of
   the induced stabilization as indicated by the electrophoretic mobility
   measurements. Similar behavior was observed in the presence of alginate
   and MgCl(2). However, the attachment efficiency kept increasing in the
   presence of CaCl2 and alginate with the increase in the electrolyte
   concentration and was greater than unity at >4 mM CaCl(2). The
   destabilization was attributed to bridging of the nanoparticles by the
   alginate-Ca(2+) system. Results from this study suggest that various NOM
   and electrolytes play significant and differing roles in the aggregation
   of boron nanoparticles in natural aquatic environments. (C) 2010

AB Studies of the fate and transport of engineered nanomaterials are
   invaluable in predicting environmental impact, bioavailability, and
   toxicity. We report on the influence of humic and fulvic acids (models
   of natural organic matter) on the phase transfer of organic-capped CdSe
   quantum dots (QDs) from hexane to water. QDs capped with
   tri-n-octylphosphine oxide, tetradecylphosphonic acid, and oleic acid,
   which were otherwise insoluble in water, were transferred into aqueous
   solutions of humic substances (HS) (Suwannee River humic acid and fulvic
   acid standards) within 1-10 days after mixing. Phase transfer was
   characterized by infrared and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, emission
   spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, electron microscopy, and
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Phase-transferred QDs were
   intact and temporarily stabilized by HS. On longer timescales, Cd(2+)
   leached into aqueous solution. Our data suggest that two mechanisms
   promote the phase transfer of QD-HS agglomerates: (1) an overcoating
   mechanism involving dispersion interactions between non-polar moieties
   of HS and hydrocarbon chains of organic capping groups and (2) a
   coordinative mechanism involving displacement of capping groups by Lewis
   basic functionalities of HS. The structure of the capping group of QDs
   influenced the relative contributions of the two mechanisms and the
   extent to which Cd(2+) leached into water. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Mineral sulfide colloids and nanoparticles are important for the aquatic
   fate and transport of toxic metals such as zinc and mercury in anaerobic
   environments. The persistence of metal sulfides in the colloidal form is
   likely to depend on surface interactions with dissolved natural organic
   matter. In this work, we investigated the sorption of cysteine and
   serine on ZnS and HgS particles and the implications for colloidal
   stability. These amino acids were used as model compounds for small
   molecular weight natural organic acids. Cysteine was found to increase
   colloidal stability by adsorbing to particle surfaces and modifying the
   surface potential of the particles. In contrast, serine did not adsorb
   in appreciable amounts and as a consequence, did not appear to alter
   surface properties and particle attachment efficiencies. The pH of the
   aqueous phase was another critical component for controlling aggregation
   kinetics of cysteine-coated ZnS particles. Colloidal stability was
   promoted at pH values greater than 7 due to deprotonation of functional
   groups on the mineral surface and sorbed cysteine molecules. These
   results indicate that specific surface coordination of thiol-containing
   natural organic acids is important for the colloidal stability of ZnS,
   HgS, and other metal sulfides in water. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Upon release of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) into the subsurface
   environment, their fate and transport and hence their potential
   environmental and public health impacts will largely depend on how
   stable these NPs are as suspended particles in the natural environment.
   In this study, we systematically examine the effect of humic acid (HA)
   on surface charge status and aggregation potential of magnetite
   (Fe(3)O(4)) NPs, selected as a model for metal oxide NPs, over a wide
   range of solution pH and ionic strength. Through zeta potential (ZP)
   measurements, we found that HA can adsorb to magnetite particles hence
   modifying their surface charge status. At low loadings, the presence of
   HA can induce a shift in the point zero of charge of due to partial
   neutralization of the positive charges on magnetite NPs. At high
   loadings, however. HA is capable of completely cover magnetite particles
   giving rise to a suspension ZP profile similar to its own (observed in
   presence of 20 mg L(-1) HA). These impacts on surface charge correspond
   well with the observed aggregation behaviors in the absence and presence
   of HA. From the dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements, fast
   aggregation, which is independent of solution chemistry, took place when
   the pH is close to the point zero charge (PZC) and the ionic strength is
   above the critical coagulation concentration (CCC). At high ionic
   strength, a small dose (2 mg L(-1)) of HA stabilized the NPs' suspension
   significantly. This stabilization effect is substantially enhanced with
   increasing HA concentration. The calculated DLVO
   (Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek) interaction energy profiles, using
   experimentally determined values of Hamaker constant, adequately support
   the experimental observations. The DLVO analysis further reveals the
   possible presence of secondary energy minima and the possibility of
   deaggregation of magnetite agglomerates. The complexation of HA-NPs and
   the HA effects on NPs aggregations were confirmed by atomic force
   microscope (AFM) observations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Assessing the environmental transport and fate of manufactured
   nanoparticles (NPs) and potential exposure risks requires models for
   predicting attachment of NPs coated with organic macromolecules in
   porous media. The objective of this study was to determine the
   properties of coated nanoparticles that control their attachment
   behavior. Deposition data for a variety of nanoparticles with different
   types of anionic organic coatings, including natural organic matter
   (NOM)-coated latex and hematite nanoparticles, and
   poly(styrenesulfonate)-, carboxymethylcellulose-, and
   polyaspartate-coated hematite and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (80
   data points), were used to develop an empirical correlation between
   measurable NP properties and their sticking coefficient (a) under a
   variety of electrolyte conditions and flow velocities. Available
   semiempirical correlations used to predict the attachment efficiency of
   electrostatically stabilized (uncoated) NPs overestimate the attachment
   efficiency of nanoparticles coated with NOM or synthetic
   polyelectrolytes because the correlations neglect electrosteric
   repulsions and the decreased friction afforded by such coatings that can
   inhibit attachment to surfaces. Adding a dimensionless parameter
   (N(LEK)) representing steric repulsions and the decreased friction force
   afforded by adsorbed NOM or anionic polyelectrolytes in the correlation
   significantly improves the correlation. This establishes the importance
   of including the adsorbed NOM- or polyelectrolyte layer properties for
   estimating the attachment efficiency of NPs in the environment. The form
   of NLEK suggests that limiting unintended transport and exposure to NPs
   could be achieved by using coatings with the smallest adsorbed mass and
   polymer density, shortest extended layer thickness, and largest
   molecular weight that would still afford the desired functionality of
   the coating.

AB Low molecular weight organic acids comprise an important pool of
   reactive ligands in aquatic systems. These acids readily bind to
   nano-sized mineral particles and thereby strongly influence a particle's
   physicochemical behavior. Predicting this influence requires the
   integration of molecular-level details that control surface complexation
   mechanisms and structures with macro-scale observations of mineral
   colloid behavior. We report on the aggregation kinetics of nano-sized
   hematite in the presence of fumaric acid and maleic acid, which are
   naturally occurring dicarboxylic acids of similar size and structure.
   Our results indicate that the structure and orientation of the adsorbed
   dianion at the hematite surface, not the adsorption mechanism, defines
   the resulting effect. Maleate, which directs both carboxyl groups to the
   surface in the form of inner- and outer-sphere surface complexes,
   enhances colloidal stability. Fumarate, however, which binds to the
   hematite surface as an outer-sphere complex with just one carboxyl group
   only slightly influenced particle stability. This outcome suggests that
   subtle differences in the structure of adsorbed acids produce important
   differences in the physicochemical behavior of particles in dilute
   aquatic systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) is used for groundwater remediation.
   Freshly synthesized bare, i.e. uncoated NZVI is bactericidal at low mg/L
   concentration, but the impact of surface modifiers and aging (partial
   oxidation) on its bactericidal properties have not been determined. Here
   we assess the effect that adsorbed synthetic polymers and natural
   organic matter (NOM) and aging (partial oxidation) have on the
   bactericidal properties of NZVI to the gram-negative bacterium,
   Escherichia coli. Exposure to 100 mg/L of bare NZVI with 28% Fe(0)
   content resulted in a 2.2-log inactivation after 10 min and a 5.2-log
   inactivation after 60 min. Adsorbed poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS),
   poly(aspartate) (PAP), or NOM on NZVI with the same Fe(0) content
   significantly decreased its toxicity, causing less than 0.2-log
   inactivation after 60 min. TEM images and heteroaggregation studies
   indicate that bare NZVI adheres significantly to cells and that the
   adsorbed polyelectrolyte or NOM prevents adhesion, thereby decreasing
   NZVI toxicity. The 1.8-log inactivation observed for bare NZVI with 7%
   Fe(0) content was lower than the 5.2-log inactivation using NZVI with
   28% Fe(0) after 1 h; however, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
   after 24 h was 5 mg/L regardless of Fe(0) content. The MIC of PSS, PAP,
   and NOM coated NZVI were much higher: 500 mg/L, 100 mg/L, and 100 mg/L,
   respectively. But the MIC was much lower than the typical injection
   concentration used in remediation (10 g/L). Complete oxidation of Fe(0)
   in NZVI under aerobic conditions eliminated its bactericidal effects.
   This study indicates that polyelectrolyte coatings and NOM will mitigate
   the toxicity of NZVI for exposure concentrations below 0.1 to 0.5 g/L
   depending on the coating and that aged NZVI without Fe(0) is relatively
   benign to bacteria.

AB The aggregation kinetics of two types of ZnO nanoparticles were
   investigated under various conditions. Distinct differences in
   aggregation kinetics were observed between the two ZnO particles. The
   aggregation of the nearly spherical ZnO (denoted as Me ZnO) exhibited
   strong dependence on the ionic strength (IS) of the solution; while
   minimal influence of Is was seen on the irregularly shaped ZnO (mixture
   of slab-like and rod-shaped particles, denoted as Mk ZnO) in the IS
   ranged tested. It is postulated that Mk ZnO possesses a critical
   coagulation concentration (CCC) below the lowest electrolyte
   concentration tested (1 mM NaCl) due to the interactions between various
   surfaces. The CCC of ZnO was found to be a function of pH; the CCC
   increased significantly as the pH was further away from the point of
   zero charge. Natural organic matter (NOM) was found to substantially
   hinder the aggregation of both types of ZnO particles (above 10 mg/L for
   Me ZnO and above 1 mg/L for Mk ZnO). A Langmuir adsorption model was
   used to describe the NOM to ZnO nanoparticle adsorption isotherms. To
   our knowledge, this is the first study to report the effect of particle
   morphology on nanoparticle aggregation, which outlines the importance of
   accounting morphology into environmental transport assessment of

   antibacterial potency, eukaryotic toxicity, environmental release, and
   particle persistence. The present study synthesizes pure, ion-free,
   citrate-stabilized nanosilver (nAg) colloids as model systems, and
   measures their time-dependent release of dissolved silver using
   centrifugal ultrafiltration and atomic absorption spectroscopy. Ion
   release is shown to be a cooperative oxidation process requiring both
   dissolved dioxygen and protons. It produces peroxide intermediates, and
   proceeds to complete reactive dissolution under some conditions. Ion
   release rates increase with temperature in the range 0-37 degrees C, and
   decrease with increasing pH or addition of humic or fulvic acids. Sea
   salts have only a minor effect on dissolved silver release. Silver
   nanoparticle surfaces can adsorb Ag(+), so even simple colloids contain
   three forms of silver: Ag(0) solids, free Ag+ or its complexes, and
   surface-adsorbed Ag(+). Both thermodynamic analysis and kinetic
   measurements indicate that Ag(0) nanciparticles will not be persistent
   in realistic environmental compartments containing dissolved oxygen. An
   empirical kinetic law is proposed that reproduces the observed effects
   of dissolution time, pH, humic/fulvic acid content, and temperature
   observed here in the low range of nanosilver concentration most relevant

AB Sorption of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) to natural organic
   matter (NOM) is an important process that affects the transport,
   transformation, bioavailability, and fate of HOCs in the environment.
   Manufactured nanoparticles (NPs) such as nano-oxides will inevitably
   enter the environment in the processes of their production, transfer,
   and use and could be coated by the ubiquitous NOM. Thus, sorption of
   HOCs to NOM in the environment could be affected by the NP interactions
   with NOM. Furthermore, the toxicity of nano-oxides could be increased
   due to the adsorbed HOCs. Therefore, sorption of phenanthrene by
   nano-Al(2)O(3) coated with humic acid (HA) was examined in this study to
   explore the possible effect of nanoparticles (NPs) on the environmental
   behavior of HOCs and the potential environmental and health risks of
   NPs.
   Four HAs were sequentially extracted with 0.1 mol/L NaOH from a peat
   soil. HAs, nano-Al(2)O(3), and HA-coated nano-Al(2)O(3) were
   characterized by techniques such as elemental analysis, solid-state
   (13)C NMR, N(2) surface area analysis, and zeta potential measurement.
   Adsorption isotherms of HAs by nano-Al(2)O(3) and phenanthrene by HAs
   and HA-coated nano-Al(2)O(3) were obtained using a batch equilibration
   technique at 25 +/- 1A degrees C. HA concentrations were measured by
   total organic carbon analysis. Phenanthrene concentrations were measured
   by liquid scintillation counting.
   The adsorption maxima of HAs by nano-Al(2)O(3) was one order of
   magnitude higher than that by soil inorganic minerals. Phenanthrene
   isotherms of HA-coated nano-Al(2)O(3) were more nonlinear than that of
   their respective bulk HAs. Concentration-dependent organic
   carbon-normalized sorption coefficients (K' (oc)) of phenanthrene by
   HA-coated nano-Al(2)O(3) were lower than those for their respective bulk
   HAs, especially at relatively high concentrations.
   Isotherm nonlinearity of phenanthrene could be interpreted by a
   combination of partitioning accompanied by linear isotherm with
   adsorption accompanied by nonlinear isotherm. HA conformation changes
   during their adsorption on nano-Al(2)O(3) could play an important role
   in phenanthrene sorption and were responsible for higher nonlinearity of
   phenanthrene isotherms and lower phenanthrene K' (oc) on the adsorbed
   HAs than their respective bulk HAs. Adsorption of HA on nano-Al(2)O(3)
   would form a more condensed HA state with higher
   pi-polarity/polarizability and lower partitioning affinity than the
   respective bulk HA, leading to an increase of relative contribution of
   adsorption to the total sorption and more nonlinear phenanthrene
   isotherms in the adsorbed HA due to the increase in phenanthrene
   adsorption affinity and decrease in phenanthrene partitioning affinity.
   Adsorption of HA on nano-Al(2)O(3) was much higher than that on soil
   oxide minerals and could form a more condensed HA state with higher
   pi-polarity/polarizability and lower partitioning affinity than the bulk
   HA, causing the significant difference in phenanthrene sorption between
   the adsorbed HA and the respective bulk HA. Therefore, once released in
   the environment, NPs such as nano-Al(2)O(3) will strongly alter the
   environmental transport, fate, and bioavailability of HOCs and could be
   potentially more toxic due to the adsorbed toxic chemicals.
   Due to the high adsorption of HA on nano-Al(2)O(3) and its significant
   effect on phenanthrene sorption, interactions of NOM with nano-oxides
   and their mechanistic relations with NOM conformation changes and HOC
   sorption merit further research. In addition, due to the higher sorption
   of phenanthrene on the HA-coated nano-Al(2)O(3) than the pure
   counterpart, the effect of NOM and HOCs on the ecotoxicity of NPs should
   be addressed in the future.

AB The colloidal stability of three structurally different humic acid
   (HA)-coated Al2O3 nanoparticles (HAs-Al2O3 NPs) was studied in the
   presence of Ca2+. HAs were obtained after sequential extractions of
   Amherst Peat Soil, Highly polar HAl-coated Al2O3 NPs exhibited strong
   aggregation in the presence of Ca2+. HA3 and HA7-coated NPs showed
   weaker aggregation due to their increased aliphaticity and low polarity.
   HA7-Al2O3 NPs displayed the weakest aggregation behavior even at
   relatively high Ca2+ concentration. The inverse stability ratio (alpha =
   1/W) was the lowest for HA7-Al2O3 NPs, reflecting that strong steric
   stabilization enhanced colloidal stability. Atomic force microscopy
   (AFM) of pure Al2O3 NPs oil Ca(2+)saturated mica clearly demonstrated
   significant aggregation following classical
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) model for hard spheres. On the
   contrary, weakly polar HA fraction produced approximately 10 nm thick
   corona of adsorbed layer around each Al2O3 NP, thus stabilizing coated
   NP suspension through steric effect. Under alkaline conditions and at
   low ionic strength, adsorbed HA chains swelled, increasing their osmotic
   potential, which in turn resulted instabilization of the colloids.
   Inherent structural variations of natural organic matter (NOM) played a
   significant part in colloidal stability of the coated NPs. Thus,
   development of sterically stabilized NPs may have potential application
   for water remediation in marine and high salinity conditions.

AB The application of nanoparticles in the processes of making commercial
   products has increased in recent years due to their unique physical and
   chemical properties. With increasing amount of commercial nanoparticles
   released into nature, their fate and effects on the ecosystem and human
   health are of growing concern. This study investigated the stability and
   morphology of three metal oxide nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. The
   commercially available nanoparticles, TiO(2), ZnO, SiO(2), aggregated
   quickly into micrometer-size particles in aqueous solutions, which may
   not threaten human health. Their changes in morphology and
   characteristics were further examined by dynamic light scattering (DLS)
   method and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Among the several
   dispersion approaches, ultrasonication was found to be the most
   effective for disaggregating nanoparticles in water. For these three
   selected nanoparticles, ZnO could not remain stable in suspensions,
   presumably due to the dissolution of particles to form high
   concentration of ions, resulting in enhanced aggregation of particles.
   In addition, the existence of dissolved organic matters stabilized
   nanoparticles in lake water and wastewater for several hours in spite of
   the high concentration of cations in these real-water samples. The fate
   of metal oxide nanoparticles in natural water bodies would be determined
   by the type and concentration of cations and organic matters. Results
   obtained in this study revealed that the stability of nanoparticles
   changed under different aqueous conditions and so did their fate in the
   environment.

AB Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are becoming increasingly popular as
   antimicrobial agents in consumer goods with consequent risk to
   environmental health from discharges. Environmentally relevant fate and
   transport investigations are limited but essential to gain understanding
   towards bioavailability and toxicology. In this study, monodisperse 15
   nm citrate-stabilised Ag NPs were synthesised, characterised and then
   fractionated by flow field-flow fractionation (FIFFF) at environmentally
   relevant conditions (pH 5 or 8, presence of natural organic
   macromolecules (NOM) and presence of sodium or calcium). At low ionic
   strength, Ag NPs particle size increased as pH increased from 5 to 8.
   However, changing the ionic strength from 10(-3) to 10(-2) M Na
   increased instability of the Ag NPs, and loss of peak at pH 5 but in the
   presence of humic substance (HS), a reduction in NP size was seen, most
   likely due to a reduction in the diffuse layer. The presence of Ca(2+)
   ions, at the higher ionic strengths caused complete loss of the solution
   Ag NPs with or without HS, most likely due to aggregation. At the lower
   Ca(2+) ionic strength the Ag NPs were still unstable, but again, in the
   presence of HS the NPs were largely dispersed. The presence of HS
   improved stability of Ag NPs under these conditions by forming a Surface
   coating resulting in both steric and charge stabilisation. This work
   implies that Ag NPs could have long residence times in aquatic systems
   in the presence of HS potentially resulting in increased
   bioavailability. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Humic substances (HS) play an important role in the reactivity and
   transport of colloids in natural environments. In particular, the
   presence of fulvic acids (FA) in natural waters modifies the
   interactions between inorganic particles and biopolymers; and makes
   difficult to predict their stability with regard to aggregation
   processes. In this study, Brownian dynamics (BD) modeling is applied to
   quantify the interactions between negatively charged FA and (i) a
   positively charged inorganic particle and (ii) a rigid neutral
   polysaccharide in aqueous solutions. Hematite and schizophyllan are
   respectively used as model colloids. Modeling the adsorption of FA at
   the hematite particle surface and on the polysaccharide is based on van
   der Waals attractive forces and Electrostatic interactions. Possible
   applications of the model, however, are not restricted to this system
   and any interaction potential or colloidal particle can be considered.
   The competition between FA adsorption and FA homocoagulation in solution
   is studied as function of the solution ionic strength. Results show
   that, under the conditions used, the amount of adsorbed FA is largely
   controlled by the solution ionic strength. At low ionic strength the
   amount of adsorbed FA is limited by the electrostatic repulsion between
   FA at the colloid surfaces and FA monolayers are formed. By increasing
   the ionic strength the number of adsorbed FA is found to increase. At a
   sufficiently large ionic strength, however, FA coagulation in solution
   may strongly compete with FA adsorption at the hematite and
   polysaccharide surfaces. FA aggregates then adsorb at the colloid
   surfaces to form extended and porous structures. Results also suggest
   that FA adsorption and structure of the adsorbed layers are mainly
   driven by the complex interplay between Electrostatic attractive and
   repulsive interactions.

AB The fate and transport of diagnostic gold nanoparticles in surface
   waters would significantly depend on their interactions with humic
   substances, which are ubiquitously found in natural aquatic systems. The
   current study employs UV-visible absorbance and fluorescence
   spectroscopy to investigate the interactions of commercial humic acid
   (HA) with gold nanoparticles having a core size of 5 nm and coated with
   two different stabilizers, beta-D-glucose and citrate. Humic substances
   (HS) are fluorescent in nature, providing a unique probe of
   nanometer-scale morphological changes for interactions between these
   natural polyelectrolytes and water-soluble gold nanoparticles. Quenching
   of fluorescence intensity was observed with beta-D-glucose-coated gold
   nanoparticles, whereas an enhancement effect was noticed with the
   citrate-coated particles when mixed with HA having concentrations of 2
   and 8 ppm (surface waters typically may contain similar to 10 ppm HS).
   Examining the quenching and enhancement of fluorescence provides insight
   into the structural changes taking place at the coated gold
   nanoparticle-HA interface. The quenching behavior suggested ligand
   exchange due to nanometer-scale contact between the HA and
   beta-D-glucose-coated gold nanoparticles, whereas the enhancement effect
   with citrate particles would indicate overcoating, leading to increased
   transfer distances for fluorescence resonance energy transfer.

AB The formation of small and large molecular polyanionic coating on the
   surface of magnetite (Fe(3)O(4)) nanoparticles and their role in the
   stability enhancement of aqueous magnetic fluids are compared. Magnetite
   was synthesized and stabilized with citric (CA) and humic (HA) acids.
   The macromolecular HA, a notable fraction of the natural organic matter
   (NOM), contains mainly carboxylic groups similarly to the CA, and both
   acids are able to form surface complexes on the equivalent to Fe-OH
   sites of iron oxides. The pH-dependent charge state of particles and
   their aggregation were quantified, and the enhanced salt tolerance of
   stabilized systems was studied. The dynamic light scattering (DLS)
   method was used to characterize colloidal stability under different
   conditions. The average particle size and electrophoretic mobility were
   measured, and the electrolyte tolerance was tested in coagulation
   kinetic measurements. The colloidal stability of magnetite dispersions
   depends sensitively on the pH and the concentration of organic acids
   present. The trace amount of HA neutralizes the positive charges on
   magnetite surface under acidic condition only in part, and so it
   promotes the aggregation between the particles having both positive
   sites and negative humate patches on the surface. Above the adsorption
   saturation, the surface becomes completely covered causing the reversal
   of charge sign and overcharging of nanoparticles. The magnetite
   nanoparticles become stabilized in a way of combined steric and
   electrostatic effects. The thicker layer of macromolecular HA provides
   better electrosteric stability than that of CA coating. However, in the
   presence of either CA or HA, the dissolution of magnetite is enhanced
   due to the complexation of iron ions in the aqueous medium. (C) 2009

AB The stability of nanoparticles in aquatic environment plays an important
   role in determining their environmental implication and potential risk
   to human health. This research studied the impact of natural organic
   matter (NOM) and divalent cations (Ca(2+)) on the stability of
   engineered metal oxide nanoparticles (e.g. ZnO, NiO, TiO(2), Fe(2)O(3)
   and SiO(2)). When nanoparticles were present in neutral water, a
   relatively weak electrolyte concentration (0.01 M KCl) could result in
   their aggregation; however, with the addition of 1 mg/L NOM, the
   negative surface charge of nanoparticles increased significantly and
   therefore their propensity to aggregate is reduced. 4 mg/L NOM
   stabilized most nanoparticles by producing -30 mV or higher zeta
   potentials. On the other hand, the negative charge that NOM imparted to
   nanoparticles could be neutralized by divalent cations (calcium ions).
   0.04 M-0.06 M Ca(2+) induced the aggregation of NOM-coated
   nanoparticles. It should be noted that among all the studied
   nanoparticles, SiO(2) exhibited the unique stability due to its low NOM
   adsorption capacity and small Hamaker constant. SiO(2) remained stable
   no matter whether the solution contained NOM or Ca(2+). (C) 2009

   varied as both a function of pH and NP:SRFA ratio, with maximum
   aggregation at near neutral pH values (6-8). SRFA fluorescence quenching
   increased non-linearly with increasing NP concentrations (>0.22 x 10(-3)

   interactions. Aggregates of iron oxide present at pH 7-8 appeared to

AB Column studies showed that the mobility of nanometer-sized
   zerovalentiron (nZVI) through granular media is greatly increased in the
   presence of natural organic matter (NOM). At NOM concentrations of 20
   mg/L or greater, the nZVI was highly mobile during transport experiments
   in 0.15-m long columns packed with medium sand. Below 20 mg/L NOM,
   mobility of the nZVI was less; however, even at 2 mg/L the nZVI showed
   significantly increased mobility compared to the no-NOM case.
   Spectrophotometric and aggregation studies of nZVI suspensions in the
   presence of NOM suggest that sorption of the NOM onto the nZVI,
   resulting in a reduced sticking coefficient may be the primary mechanism
   of enhanced mobility. Modeling the mobility of nZVI in porous media with
   filtration theory is challenging, but calibration of a simple model with
   experimental results from the column experiments reported here allows
   simulation of transport distances during injection. The simulation
   results show that the increased mobility due to NOM combined with the
   decrease in mobility due to decreased velocity with distance from an
   injection well could produce an injection zone that is wide enough to be
   useful for remediation but small enough to avoid reaching unwanted
   receptors.

   modeling of NOM-TiO2 and NOM-NOM interactions, batch study on the NOM
   adsorption onto TiO2 surface, and bench-scale study on the treatment of
   NOM-containing feed waters using a hybrid process that combines
   ozonation and ultrafiltration with a 5 kDa ceramic (TiO2 surface)
   membrane. It was demonstrated that depending on pH and TiO2 loading, the
   adsorption of NOM species is controlled by either the availability of
   divalent cations or by preozonation of NOM. XDLVO surface energy
   analysis predicts NOM adsorption onto TiO2 in the ozone-controlled
   regime but not in the calcium-controlled regime. In both regimes,
   short-range NOM-NOM and NOM-TiO2 interactions were governed by acid-base
   and van der Waals forces, whereas the role of electrostatic forces was
   relatively insignificant. Ozonation increased the surface energy of NOM,
   contributing to the hydrophilic repulsion component of the NOM-NOM and
   NOM-TiO2 interactions. In the calcium-controlled regime, neither
   NOM-TiO2 nor NOM-NOM interaction controlled adsorption. Non-XDLVO
   interactions such as intermolecular bridging by calcium were
   hypothesized to be responsible for the observed adsorption behavior.
   Adsorption data proved to be highly predictive of the permeate flux
   performance.

   presence of amorphous Fe and Al hydroxide, Na(+) (30 mM), and Ca(2+) (30
   mM). Removal of CMC-ANTNPs was more significant in the presence of
   either Ca(2+) or Fe-hydroxide. More retardation and incomplete
   breakthrough of the CMC-ANTNPs was observed in the mineral-coated sands.
   This is possibly due to an order of magnitude increase in the surface
   area of miner l-coated sands compared with the clean quartz sand grains
   and the potential for chelation between CMC bound to ANTNPs and Fe and
   Al hydroxides. Chemical-colloidal interactions such as chemicomplexation
   and ligand exchange were the most important factor controlling mobility
   of CMC-ANTNPs in mineral-coated sands.

AB Adsorption of natural organic matter (NOM) on nanoparticles (NPs) is
   important for evaluating their transport, transfer, and fate in the
   environment, which will also affect sorption of hydrophobic organic
   compounds (HOCs) by NPs and thereby potentially alter the toxicity of
   NPs and the fate, transport, and bioavailability of HOCs in the
   environment. Therefore, the adsorption behavior of humic acids (HA) by
   four types of nano-oxides (i.e., TiO(2), SiO(2), Al(2)O(3), and ZnO) was
   examined in this study to explore their interaction mechanisms using
   techniques including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and
   elemental, zeta potential, and surface area analyses. Adsorption of HA
   was observed on nanosized TiO(2), Al(2)O(3), and ZnO but not on
   nano-SiO(2). Furthermore, HA adsorption was pH-dependent. HA adsorption
   by nano-oxides was mainly induced by electrostatic attraction and ligand
   exchange between HA and nano-oxide surfaces. Surface hydrophilicity and
   negative charges of nano-oxides affected their adsorption of HA.
   However, the maxima of HA adsorption on nano-oxides were limited by the
   surface area of nano-oxides. HA phenolic OH and COOH groups were
   responsible for its ligand exchange with nano-TiO(2) and nano-ZnO(,)
   respectively, while either HA COOH or HA phenolic/aliphatic OH was
   responsible for its ligand exchange with nano-Al(2)O(3). HA adsorption
   decreased the micropore surface area of nano-oxides but not the external
   surface area because of the micropore blockage. HA adsorption also
   decreased the zeta potential of nano-oxides, indicating that HA-coated
   nano-oxides could be more easily dispersed and suspended and more stable
   in solution than uncoated ones because of their enhanced electrostatic
   repulsion.

AB Speciation of mercury(II) in the aquatic environment and coordination to
   natural organic matter (NOM) and sulfides governs the bioavailability
   and mobility of mercury in water and sediment. While previous studies on
   aqueous Hg(II) speciation have focused on competitive binding of
   dissolved species, the purpose of this study was to explore the
   potential for HgS nanoparticles that coprecipitate with NOM in solution.
   Dynamic light scattering was used to monitor the size of HgS colloids
   growing over time. The results indicated that humic substances decreased
   observed growth rates of particles and stabilized aggregates smaller
   than 0.21 mu m for at least 8 h. Thiol-containing organic acids such as
   cysteine and thioglycolate also decreased growth of HgS particles.
   Growth rates were also monitored as a function of monovalent electrolyte
   concentration, humic type, and humic concentration. HgS particles that
   formed in the presence of humics and thiolates were able to pass through
   conventional filters (<0.2 mu m) and appeared to consist of aggregates
   of nanocrystals in TEM images. Furthermore, 96% of HgS aggregates were
   removed from aqueous suspension when exposed to octanol, indicating that
   the particles could be incorrectly identified as dissolved complexes
   (e.g., HgS((aq))(0)) in bioavailability models. Hg speciation
   calculations were conducted to consider lower Hg concentrations observed
   in sediment porewater. While the calculations depended on Hg binding
   constants that can vary by orders of magnitude, the results indicated
   that HgS(,) could be oversaturated in filtered porewater, particularly
   at low dissolved sulfide levels (micromolar or lower). These insights
   suggest that nanoparticulate HgS can exist in surface waters and
   porewater of contaminated sediments as a result of kinetically hindered
   aggregation/precipitation reactions. Further studies are needed to
   address the importance of nanoscale HgS particles for governing the
   reactivity and bioavailability of mercury in the environment.

AB Phenanthrene sorption by nano-TiO2 and nano-ZnO particles was enhanced
   significantly by coated humic acids (HAS), implying that additional
   toxicity can be potentially given to these nano-oxides by adsorbed HOCs
   once released to the environment. Phenanthrene isotherms of adsorbed HA
   on nano-TiO2 and nano-ZnO were more nonlinear than that of their
   respective bulk HA. Both HA conformation changes and fractionation were
   observed upon HA adsorption on nano-TiO2 and nano-ZnO, which further
   affected phenanthrene sorption. Nano-TiO2 and nano-ZnO interacted with
   different functional groups of HA (i.e., phenolic OH with nano-TiO2,
   while COOH with nano-ZnO), leading to different conformations of
   adsorbed HA. Interaction of HA phenolic OH with nano-TiO2 increased the
   pi-polarity/polarizability of adsorbed HA and, consequently, its
   phenanthrene adsorption affinity and isotherm nonlinearity. Interactions
   of COOH groups on HA aromatic rings with nano-ZnO would also increase
   the pi-polarity/polarizability of adsorbed HA and its phenanthrene
   adsorption affinity, whereas interactions of COOH groups on HA aliphatic
   chains with nano-ZnO would make the adsorbed HA be in a more condensed
   state with lower partitioning affinity. Increase in adsorption and
   decrease in partitioning were responsible for the more nonlinear
   phenanthrene isotherms of adsorbed HA than bulk HA.

AB The increasing use of nanomaterials in consumer products has led to
   increased concerns about their potential environmental and health
   impacts. To better understand the transport, fate, and behavior of
   nanoparticles in aquatic systems, it is essential to understand their
   interactions with different components of natural waters including
   natural organic matter over a broad range of physicochemical conditions.
   Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy was used to determine the
   diffusion coefficients of TiO(2) nanoparticles having a nominal size of
   5 nm. The effects of a various concentrations of the Suwannee River
   Fulvic Acid (SRFA) and the roles of pH and ionic strength were
   evaluated. Aggregation of the bare TiO(2) nanoparticles increased for pH
   values near the zero point of charge. At any given pH, an increase in
   ionic strength generally resulted in increased aggregation. Furthermore,
   conditions which favored adsorption of the SRFA resulted in less
   aggregation of the TiO(2) nanoparticles, presumably due to increased
   steric repulsion. Under the conditions studied here, nanoparticle
   dispersions were often stable for environmentally relevant conditions of
   SRFA, pH, and ionic strength, suggesting that in the natural
   environment, TiO(2) dispersion might occur to a greater extent than
   expected.

AB The surface coating, aggregation behavior and aggregate structure of
   unpurified iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) at variable pH and in the
   absence and presence of natural organic matter (NOM, Suwannee River
   humic acid, SRHA) have been previously studied in Baalousha et al.
   [Baalousha, M., Manciulea, A., Cumberland, S., Kendall, K., Lead, J.R.,
   Aggregation and surface properties of iron oxide nanoparticles;
   influence of pH and natural organic matter. Environ Toxicol Chem 2008;
   27: 1875-1882.]. Here the aggregation behavior of iron oxide NPs at
   variable concentrations of NPs and SRHA, and the disaggregation behavior
   of iron oxide NP aggregates in the absence and presence of SRHA are
   investigated. The increase of NP concentration enhances their
   aggregation, particularly at pH values close to the point of zero charge
   (PZC). High concentration of SRHA (100 mg l(-1)) shifts the NP (100 mg
   l(-1)) PZC charge and aggregation maximum towards lower pHs, while low
   concentration (10 mg l(-1)) shows low or no effect. The disaggregation
   behavior of iron oxide NP aggregates was investigated at pH 7 and at
   increasing concentrations of SRHA. High concentrations (50 and 100 mg
   l(-1)) of SRHA induced the disaggregation of iron oxide NP aggregates
   with time, which was not the case at lower concentrations (10 mg l(-1))
   or in the absence of SRHA. The disaggregation was triggered by the
   enhanced surface charge induced by the sorption of SRHA molecules. The
   disaggregation rate increased with SRHA concentration and decreased with
   time. Two regimes of disaggregation were identified, a fast regime of
   "fragmentation" at the first 15 days of the experiment and a slow regime
   of "erosion" afterwards. The formation of small aggregates of about 170
   nm and surface coating of several nanometers of SRHA on iron oxide NPs
   confirm the role of NOM in the disaggregation process and indicate that
   NPs might mimic the behavior of natural colloids. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Imminent commercialization of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) has
   raised concerns regarding the potential environmental impact of these
   materials. Understanding the partitioning behavior and obtaining
   information on the mobility and persistence of QDs in water is key to
   evaluating potential ecological hazards posed by QDs in the environment.
   The role of natural organic matter (NOM) in the phase transfer of
   trioctylphosphine oxide-capped CdSe QDs from an organic solvent to water
   has been investigated. Results show that humic and fulvic acids, which
   have been used as model NOM, facilitate the stabilization of
   organic-capped QDs in water in less than 24 h. Spectroscopic studies
   indicate that some or all of the organic ligands of COS are conserved
   during the phase transfer. The displacement of organic ligands by NOM
   also appears to play a role in phase transfer. This NOM-mediated phase
   transfer has also been demonstrated using two natural surface water
   samples. This study presents the first evidence of the stabilization of
   QDs in water by humic substances in real environmental samples,
   illustrating that interactions with NOM will play a significant role in
   the fate and transport of QDs in natural aquatic systems.

AB Background: The dispersion-aggregation behaviors of suspended colloids
   in rivers and estuaries are affected by the compositions of suspended
   materials (i.e., clay minerals vs. organic macromolecules) and salinity.
   Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the dispersion and
   aggregation mechanisms of suspended particles under simulated river and
   estuarine conditions. The average hydrodynamic diameters of suspended
   particles (representing degree of aggregation) and zeta potential
   (representing the electrokinetic properties of suspended colloids and
   aggregates) were determined for systems containing suspended
   montmorillonite, humic acid, and/or chitin at the circumneutral pH over
   a range of salinity (0-7.2 psu).
   Results: The montmorillonite-only system increased the degree of
   aggregation with salinity increase, as would be expected for suspended
   colloids whose dispersion-aggregation behavior is largely controlled by
   the surface electrostatic properties and van der Waals forces. When
   montmorillonite is combined with humic acid or chitin, the aggregation
   of montmorillonite was effectively inhibited. The surface interaction
   energy model calculations reveal that the steric repulsion, rather than
   the increase in electronegativity, is the primary cause for the
   inhibition of aggregation by the addition of humic acid or chitin.
   Conclusion: These results help explain the range of
   dispersion-aggregation behaviors observed in natural river and estuarine
   systems. It is postulated that the composition of suspended particles,
   specifically the availability of steric polymers such as those contained
   in humic acid, determine whether the river suspension is rapidly
   aggregated and settled or remains dispersed in suspension when it
   encounters increasingly saline environments of estuaries and oceans.

   Chlorella kesslerii on the stability and transformation of
   carboxyl-PEG-CdSe/ZnS core/shell quantum dots (QDs) in terms of number,
   hydrodynamic size and fluorescence of individual particles, was studied
   by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Obtained results demonstrated
   that QDs form stable dispersions at nanomolar concentrations under
   conditions typical for freshwaters. The presence of 5 or 15 mg C L -1 of
   humic acid or 50 mg C L -1 EPS did not significantly affect these
   parameters. In contrast, 5 or 50 mg C L -1 alginate at ionic strength of
   10 mM shifted the hydrodynamic radius toward larger values, suggesting a
   possible capture of QDs by the linear alginate chains. The addition of
   microalga to the QD dispersions resulted in a slight reduction of the
   number of QDs and a significant decline in the fluorescence of

AB The fate and transport of diagnostic gold nanoparticles in surface

   substances, which are ubiquitously found in natural aquatic systems. The
   current study employs UV-visible absorbance and fluorescence
   spectroscopy to investigate the interactions of commercial humic acid
   (HA) with gold nanoparticles having a core size of 5 nm and coated with
   two different stabilizers, beta-D-glucose and citrate. Humic substances
   (HS) are fluorescent in nature, providing a unique probe of
   nanometer-scale morphological changes for interactions between these
   natural polyelectrolytes and water-soluble gold nanoparticles. Quenching
   of fluorescence intensity was observed with beta-D-glucose-coated gold
   nanoparticles, whereas an enhancement effect was noticed with the
   citrate-coated particles when mixed with HA having concentrations of 2
   and 8 ppm (surface waters typically may contain ~10 ppm HS). Examining
   the quenching and enhancement of fluorescence provides insight into the
   structural changes taking place at the coated gold nanoparticle-HA
   interface. The quenching behavior suggested ligand exchange due to
   nanometer-scale contact between the HA and beta-D-glucose-coated gold
   nanoparticles, whereas the enhancement effect with citrate particles
   would indicate overcoating, leading to increased transfer distances for
   fluorescence resonance energy transfer.

AB In this work, data for the interactions between humic acid (HA) or
   fulvic acid (FA) with phosphate ions at the surface of goethite
   (alpha-FeOOH) are presented. The results show very clear differences
   between HA and FA in their interactions with phosphate at goethite
   surface. HA is strongly bound to goethite but surprisingly does not
   strongly affect the phosphate binding, whereas FA is less strongly
   bound, but these molecules have a very large effect on the phosphate
   adsorption, and vice versa. Phosphate adsorption to goethite in the
   presence of adsorbed HA or FA can be well predicted with the LCD model
   (ligand and charge distribution). According to the model calculations,
   the nature of the interactions between HA or FA with phosphate at
   goethite surface is mainly electrostatic. The stronger effects of FA on
   phosphate adsorption are caused by its spatial location which is closer
   to the oxide surface, and as a consequence, the electrostatic
   interactions between adsorbed FA particles and phosphate ions are much
   stronger than for HA particles. This is the first time that effects of
   natural organic matter (NOM) on an anion adsorption are predicted
   successfully using an integrated ion-binding model for oxides and for
   humics that accounts for chemical heterogeneity of NOM.

AB The colloidal behavior of aluminum oxide nanoparticles (NPs) was
   investigated as a function of pH and in the presence of two structurally
   different humic acids (HAs), Aldrich HA (AHA) and the seventh HA
   fraction extracted from Amherst peat soil (HA7). Dynamic light
   scattering (DLS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were employed to
   determine the colloidal behavior of the NPs. Influence of pH and HAs on
   the surface charges of the NPs was determined. zeta-Potential data
   clearly showed that the surface charge of the NPs decreased with
   increasing pH and reached the point of zero charge (ZPC) at pH 7.9.
   Surface charge of the NPs also decreased with the addition of HAs. The
   NPs tend to aggregate as the pH of the suspension approaches ZPC, where
   van der Waals attraction forces dominate over electrostatic repulsion.
   However, the NP colloidal suspension was stable in the pHs far from ZPC.
   Colloidal stability was strongly enhanced in the presence of HAs at the
   pH of ZPC or above it, but in acidic conditions NPs showed strong
   aggregation in the presence of HAs. AFM imaging revealed the presence of
   long-chain fractions in HA7, which entangled with the NPs to form large
   aggregates. The association of HA with the NP surface can be assumed to
   follow a two-step process, possibly the polar fractions of the HA7
   sorbed on the NP surface followed by entanglement with the long-chain
   fractions. Thus, our study demonstrated that the hydrophobic nature of
   the HA molecules strongly influenced the aggregation of colloidal NPs,
   possibly through their conformational behavior in a particular solution
   condition. Therefore, various organic matter samples will result in
   different colloidal behavior of NPs, subsequently their environmental
   fate and transport.

AB In sulfidic aquatic systems, metal sulfides can control the mobility and
   bioavailability of trace metal pollutants such as zinc, mercury, and
   silver. Nanoparticles of ZnS and other metal sulfides are known to exist
   in oxic and anoxic waters. However, the processes that lead to their
   persistence in the aquatic environment are relatively unknown. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the importance of dissolved
   natural organics in stabilizing nanoparticulate ZnS that precipitates
   under environmentally relevant conditions. Precipitation and growth of
   ZnS particles were investigated in the presence of dissolved humic acid
   and low-molecular weight organic acids that are prevalent in sediment
   porewater. Dynamic light scattering was used to monitor the hydrodynamic
   diameter of particles precipitating in laboratory solutions. Zn
   speciation was also measured by filtering the ZnS solutions (< 0.2 mu m)
   and using anodic stripping voltammetry to confirm that Zn was
   coordinated to sulfide during the precipitation experiments and not to
   the dissolved organic ligands. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and
   electron microscopy were used to confirm that amorphous particles
   containing Zn and S were precipitating in the suspensions. Observed
   growth rates of ZnS particles varied by orders of magnitude, depending
   on the type and concentration of organic ligand in solution. In the
   presence of humic acid and thiol-containing ligands (cysteine,
   glutathione, and thioglycolate), observed growth rates decreased by 1-3
   orders of magnitude relative to controls without the ligands. In
   contrast, growth rates of the particles were consistently within I order
   of magnitude of the ligand-free control when oxygen- and
   amine-containing ligands (oxalate, serine, and glycolate) were present.
   Furthermore, particle growth rates decreased with an increase in thiol
   concentration and increased with NaNO(3) electrolyte concentration.
   These studies suggest that specific surface interactions with
   thiol-containing organics may be one factor that contributes to the
   persistence of naturally occurring and anthropogenic nanoparticles of
   ZnS and other metal sulfides in the aquatic environment.

AB Sorption of pyrene by regular and nanoscaled aluminum, zinc, and
   titanium oxides was examined. All oxides had low sorption for pyrene
   because of sorbed water molecules. Due to the larger surface area (SA)
   of nanoparticles, they had higher sorption for pyrene than the regular
   ones. Organic matter (0 M) coating greatly enhanced pyrene sorption by
   all oxides, noting the importance of sorbed OM in sorption of
   hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs). Due to higher sorption site
   density in the sorbed OM phase on the regular oxide surfaces,
   SA-normalized distribution coefficients (K(dSA)) of pyrene by OM-regular
   oxide complexes (6.0-40.6) were greater than the OM-coated oxide
   nanoparticles (0.7-12.5). Furthermore,the OM-regular oxide complexes had
   higher organic carbon content-normalized KdSA values of pyrene (48-17
   300) than the OM-nanoscaled oxide complexes (15-1530). This variation
   may be due to different physical forms and fractionation of the loaded
   OM on regular and nanoscaled oxide particles.

AB Humic acid (HA) coated Fe3O4 nanciparticles (Fe3O4/HA) were developed
   for the removal of toxic Hg(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), and Cu(II) from water.
   Fe3O4/HA were prepared by a coprecipitation procedure with cheap and
   environmentally friendly iron salts and HA. TOC and XPS analysis showed
   the as-prepared Fe3O4/ HA contains similar to 11% (w/w) of HA which are
   fractions abundant in O and N-based functional groups. TEM images and
   laser particle size analysis revealed the Fe3O4/HA (with similar to 10
   nm Fe3O4 cores) aggregated in aqueous suspensions to form aggregates
   with an average hydrodynamic size of similar to 140 nm. With a
   saturation magnetization of 79.6 emu/g, the Fe3O4/HA can be simply
   recovered from water with magnetic separations at low magnetic field
   gradients within a few minutes. Sorption of the heavy metals to Fe3O4/HA
   reached equilibrium in less than 15 min, and agreed well to the Langmuir
   adsorption model with maximum adsorption capacities from 46.3 to 97.7
   mg/g. The Fe3O4/HA was stable in tap water, natural waters, and acidic/
   basic solutions ranging from 0.1 M HCl to 2 M NaOH with low leaching of
   Fe (<= 3.7%) and HA (<= 5.3%). The Fe3O4/HA was able to remove over 99%
   of Hg(II) and Pb(II) and over 95% of COO and Cd(II) in natural and tap
   water at optimized pH. Leaching back of the Fe3O4/HA sorbed heavy metals
   in water was found to be negligible.

AB The interactions between unpurified manufactured nanoparticles (NPs;
   iron oxide NPs, similar to 7 nm) and standard Suwannee River humic acid
   (SRHA) were investigated under a range of environmentally relevant
   conditions. At low pH, approximately 35% of the total iron was in the
   dissolved phase (< 1 kDa), present from the initial synthesis, whereas
   at pH more than 4, this concentration was negligible because of the
   formation of new particles via hydrolysis. Dynamic light scattering
   results indicated that extensive aggregation of NPs began at
   approximately pH 5 to 6 and reached a maximum at approximately pH 8.5,
   whereas with added SRHA, aggregation was shifted to lower pH values of 4
   to 5 and was affected by SRHA concentration. Aggregation could be
   explained mainly by charge neutralization. Further, more detailed
   investigations by flow field-flow fractionation and
   transmission-electron microscopy were performed under a more restricted
   set of conditions (pH 2 - 6) to examine the aggregation process. Results
   indicated the formation of SRHA surface coating on iron oxide NPs of
   approximately 1 nm and the increase in thickness of this coating with
   the increase of SRHA concentration. Iron oxide NPs were shown to form
   increasingly large aggregates with increases in both pH (from 2 to 6)
   and SRHA concentration (from 0 to 25 mg/L). The structure and
   aggregation mechanism of these aggregates were found to be both pH and
   SRHA concentration dependent, with open, porous aggregates in the
   absence of SRHA and compact aggregates in the presence of SRHA.

AB The increasing exploitation of nanomaterials into many consumer and
   other products is raising concerns as these nanomaterials are likely to
   be released into the environment. Due to our lack of knowledge about the
   environmental chemistry, transport and ecotoxicology of nanomaterials,
   it is of paramount importance to study how natural aquatic colloids can
   interact with manufactured gold nanoparticles as these interactions will
   determine their environmental fate and behaviour. In this context, our
   work aims to quantify the effect of naturally occurring riverine
   macromolecules - International Humic Substances Society (IHSS) Suwannee
   River Humic Acid Standard (SRHA) - on citrate- and acrylate-stabilized
   gold nanoparticles. The influence of SRHA on the stability of the gold
   colloids was studied as a function of pH by UV-visible absorption
   spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). At high ionic strengths (0.1 M), extensive and rapid
   aggregation occurred, while more subtle effects were observed at lower
   ionic strength values. Evidence was found that SRHA enhances particle
   stability at extreme pH values (ionic strength < 0.01 M) by substituting
   and/or over-coating the original stabilizer on the gold nanoparticle
   surface, thus affecting surface charge and chemistry. These findings
   have important implications for the fate and behaviour of nanoparticles
   in the environment and their ecotoxicity. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Injection of nanoscale zero-valent iron (NZVI) is potentially a
   promising technology for remediation of contaminated groundwaters.
   However, the efficiency of this process is significantly hindered by the
   rapid aggregation of the iron nanoparticles. The aim of this study was
   to enhance the colloidal stability of the nanoparticles through the
   addition of the "green" polymer guar gum. We evaluated the properties of
   guar gum and its influence on the surface properties, particle size,
   aggregation, and sedimentation of iron nanoparticles. Commercial iron
   nanoparticles were dispersed in guar gum solutions, and their
   aggregation and sedimentation behaviors were compared to those of bare
   iron nanoparticles and commercial nanoparticles modified with a
   biodegradable polymer (polyaspartate). High performance size exclusion
   chromatography, charge titration, and viscosity assessment showed that
   guar gum is a high molecular weight polymer which is nearly neutrally
   charged, rendering it suitable for steric stabilization of the iron
   nanoparticles. Electrophoretic mobility measurements demonstrated the
   ability of guar gum to adsorb on the nanoparticles, forming a slightly
   negatively charged layer. Dynamic light scattering experiments were
   conducted to estimate the particle size of the different nanoparticle
   suspensions and to determine the aggregation behavior at different ionic
   strengths. Guar gum effectively reduced the hydrodynamic radius of the
   bare nanoparticles from 500 nm to less than 200 nm and prevented
   aggregation of the nanoparticles even at very high salt concentrations
   (0.5 M NaCl and 3 MM CaCl(2)). Sedimentation profiles of the different
   nanoparticle suspensions confirmed the improved stability of the iron
   nanoparticles in the presence of guar gum. The results strongly suggest
   that guar gum can be used to effectively deliver stabilized zero-valent
   iron nanoparticles for remediation of contaminated groundwater aquifers.

AB In this study, the adsorption of two organic acids, oxalic acid and
   adipic acid, on TiO2 nanoparticles was investigated at room temperature,
   298 K. Solution-phase measurements were used to quantify the extent and
   reversibility of oxalic acid and adipic acid adsorption on anatase
   nanoparticles with primary particle sizes of 5 and 32 nm. At all pH
   values considered, there were minimal differences in measured Langmuir
   adsorption constants, K-ads, or surface-area-normalized maximum
   adsorbate-surface coverages, Gamma(max), between 5 and 32 nm particles.
   Although macroscopic differences in the reactivity of these organic
   acids as a function of nanoparticle size were not observed, ATR-FIFIR
   spectroscopy showed some distinct differences in the absorption bands
   present for oxalic acid adsorbed on 5 nm particles compared to 32 mn
   particles, suggesting different adsorption sites or a different
   distribution of adsorption sites for oxalic acid on the 5 nm particles.
   These results illustrate that molecular-level differences in
   nanoparticle reactivity can still exist even when macroscopic
   differences are not observed from solution phase measurements. Our
   results also allowed the impact of nanoparticle aggregation on acid
   uptake to be assessed. It is clear that particle aggregation occurs at
   all pH values and that organic acids can destabilize nanoparticle
   suspensions. Furthermore, 5 nm particles can form larger aggregates
   compared to 32 nm particles under the same conditions of pH and solid
   concentrations. The relative reactivity of 5 and 32 mn particles as
   determined from Langmuir adsorption parameters did not appear to vary
   greatly despite differences that occur in nanoparticle aggregation for
   these two different size nanoparticles. Although this potentially
   suggests that aggregation does not impact organic acid uptake on anatase
   particles, these data clearly show that challenges remain in assessing
   the available surface area for adsorption in nanoparticle aqueous
   suspensions because of aggregation.

AB In the interest of fully assessing the potential environmental risks
   linked to "nanolitter," we need to be able to predict the persistence,
   toxicity, and mobility of engineered nanomaterials. in the natural
   subsurface environment. To examine the effects of particle size and
   natural organic matter on nanoparticle mobility, laboratory-scale
   filtration experiments were performed using different sized model
   nanomaterials (i.e., latex colloids having diameters of 50, 110, and
   1500 nm) in the presence and absence of 5.0 mg/L Suwannee River humic
   acid (SRHA). At low ionic strengths (1-10 mM KCI), an increase in
   attachment efficiency (alpha) with increasing particle size was
   observed. This result contrasts with predictions of particle filtration
   based on attachment in the primary energy minimum of the particle-grain
   interaction energy profile evaluated using
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. The presence of SRHA
   generally resulted in a decrease in alpha over the range of experimental
   conditions investigated. Results of particle transport experiments
   combined with particle characterization measurements suggest that the
   decrease in colloid attachment in the presence of SRHA is related to the
   combined influence of the mechanisms of charge stabilization and steric
   stabilization. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) particles are 5-40 nm sized
   Fe(0)/Fe-oxide particles that rapidly transform many environmental
   contaminants to benign products and are a promising in situ remediation
   agent. Rapid aggregation and limited mobility in water-saturated porous
   media limits the ability to deliver NZVI dispersions in the subsurface.
   This study prepares stable NZVI dispersions through physisorption of
   commercially available anionic polyelectrolytes, characterizes the
   adsorbed polymer layer, and correlates the polymer coating properties
   with the ability to prevent rapid aggregation and sedimentation of NZVI
   dispersions. Poly(styrene sulfonate) with molecular weights of 70 k and
   1,000 k g/mol (PSS70K and PSS1M), carboxymethyl cellulose with molecular
   weights of 90 k and 700 k g/mol (CMC90K and CMC700K), and polyaspartate
   with molecular weights of 2.5 k and 10 k g/mol (PAP2.5K and 10K) were
   compared. Particle size distributions were determined by dynamic light
   scattering during aggregation. The order of effectiveness to prevent
   rapid aggregation and stabilize the dispersions was PSS70K(83%) >
   approximate to PAP10K(82%) > PAP2.5K(72%) > CMC700K(52%), where
   stability is defined operationally as the volume percent of particles
   that do not aggregate after 1 h. CMC90K and PSS1M could not stabilize
   RNIP relative to bare RNIP. A similar trend was observed for their
   ability to prevent sedimentation, with 40, 34, 32, 20, and 5 wt%, of the
   PSS70K, PAP10K, PAP2.5K, CMC700K, and CMC90K modified NZVI remaining
   suspended after 7 h of quiescent settling, respectively. The stable
   fractions with respect to both aggregation and sedimentation correlate
   well with the adsorbed polyelectrolyte mass and thickness of the
   adsorbed polyelectrolyte layers as determined by Oshima's soft particle
   theory. A fraction of the particles cannot be stabilized by any modifier
   and rapidly agglomerates to micron sized aggregates, as is also observed
   for unmodified NZVI. This non-dispersible fraction is attributed to
   strong magnetic attractions among the larger particles present in the
   polydisperse NZVI slurry, as the magnetic attractive forces increase as
   r(6).

AB Early-stage aggregation kinetics studies of alginate-coated hematite
   nanoparticles in solutions containing alkaline-earth metal cations
   revealed enhanced aggregation rates in the presence of Ca2+, Sr2+, and
   Ba2+, but not with Mg2+. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging
   of the aggregates provided evidence that alginate gel formation was
   essential for enhanced aggregation to occur. Dynamic light scattering
   (DLS) aggregation results clearly indicated that a much lower
   concentration of Ba2+ compared to Ca2+ and Sr2+ was required to achieve
   a similar degree of enhanced aggregation in each system. To elucidate
   the relationship between the alginate's affinities for divalent cations
   and the enhanced aggregation of the alginate-coated hematite
   nanoparticles, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to probe the
   interaction forces between alginate-coated hematite surfaces under the
   solution chemistries used for the aggregation study. Maximum adhesion
   forces, maximum pull-off distances, and the work of adhesion were used
   as indicators to gauge the alginate's affinity for the divalent cations
   and the resulting attractive interactions between alginate-coated
   hematite nanoparticles. The results showed that alginate had higher
   affinity for Ba2+ than either Sr2+ or Ca2+. This same trend was
   consistent with the cation concentrations required for comparable
   enhanced aggregation kinetics, suggesting that the rate of alginate gel
   formation controls the enhanced aggregation kinetics. An aggregation
   mechanism incorporating the gelation of alginate is proposed to explain
   the accelerated aggregate growth in the presence of Ca2+, Sr2+, and
   Ba2+.

AB Batch experiments were performed to investigate the feasibility of humic
   acid (HA) removal by synthetic nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) and its
   interaction with As(III) and As(V), the most poisonous and abundant of
   groundwater pollutants. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy
   (HR-TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the
   particle size, surface morphology of the pristine NZVI and HA-treated
   NZVI (NZVI-HA), and the zero valence state of the pristine NZVI. It was
   determined that HA was completely removed by NZVI (0.3 g/L) within a few
   minutes, at a wide range of initial pH values (similar to 3.0-12.0).
   Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and laser light scattering (zeta
   potential measurement) studies confirmed that NZVI-HA forms inner-sphere
   surface complexation at different initial pH conditions. The effects of
   competing anions showed that there was complete removal of HA in the
   presence of 10 mM NO3- and SO42- whereas HA removal was observed 0%, 18%
   and 22% in presence of 10 mM H2PO42-, HCO3- and H4SiO40, respectively.
   However, the presence of 2 mM Ca2+ and Mg2+ enhanced HA removal from 17
   mg g(-1) to 76 mg g(-1) and 55 mg g(-1), respectively. Long-term
   time-resolved studies of XRD and field emission scanning electron
   microscopy (FE-SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) revealed the
   formation of various types of new iron oxides (magnetite, maghemite, and
   lepidocrocites) during the continuous reaction of HA in the presence of
   water and NZVI at 1, 30, 60, and 90 days. In addition, the
   surface-area-normalized rate constant (k(sa)) of adsorption of As(III)
   and As(V) onto NZVI was reduced in the presence of HA (20 mg L-1), from
   100% to 43% and 68%, respectively. Our results show the potential use of
   NZVI in removing HA and its possible effects on arsenic removal during
   the application of NZVI in groundwater remediation.

AB The electrokinetics and rheology of a model alumina suspension has been
   investigated in the presence of a series of natural organic matter (NOM)
   fractions from soil and aquatic sources. The role of natural organic
   matter in changing both the dispersed state of the solids and the
   rheology of concentrated suspensions has been investigated. The data
   shows that at high surface coverage there is a good correlation between
   the nature of the adsorption layer and the electrokinetic and rheology
   responses. The data highlights key differences between the different
   fractions in aiding dispersion. At intermediate surface coverage, the
   correlation is less robust particularly for the more hydrophilic NOM
   fractions. The measured value of the electrokinetic potential is no
   longer a good indicator of colloidal stability as indicated by a DLVO
   type analysis. The reason may be due to the adsorbed layer showing a
   different response to particle movement in electrokinetic measurements
   than it does in static rheology measurements. In the latter case, the
   behaviour is dominated by particle interaction. [All rights reserved

AB The electrokinetics and rheology of a model alumina suspension has been
   investigated in the presence of a series of natural organic matter (NOM)
   fractions from soil and aquatic sources. The role of natural organic
   matter in changing both the dispersed state of the solids and the
   rheology of concentrated suspensions has been investigated. The data
   shows that at high surface coverage there is a good correlation between
   the nature of the adsorption layer and the electrokinetic and rheology
   responses. The data highlights key differences between the different
   fractions in aiding dispersion. At intermediate surface coverage, the
   correlation is less robust particularly for the more hydrophilic NOM
   fractions. The measured value of the electrokinetic potential is no
   longer a good indicator of colloidal stability as indicated by a DLVO
   type analysis. The reason may be due to the adsorbed layer showing a
   different response to particle movement in electrokinetic measurements
   than it does in static rheology measurements. In the latter case, the
   behaviour is dominated by particle interaction. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB The organic matter content and ionic composition of soil solutions have
   a dominant effect on soil structure, forming gradually an aggregation of
   mineral particles, in which clay fractions play a determining role. The
   colloidal interaction of particles, including repulsion and attraction,
   changes with their inherent surface properties and the interfacial layer
   composition around them, resulting in chemical and physical equilibria
   between solid and aqueous phases. These interactions and their
   relationship were studied in model systems containing soil constituents
   having a definite role in the formation of soil structure and are
   organized into two parts, here the interfacial processes as part 1, with
   the particle network formation in the second part. The adsorption of
   humic acid (HA) on montmorillonite was studied under conditions relevant
   to the environment at pH similar to 6.5 and 0.0014 M NaCl. The effect of
   Ca loading from 0.0013 to 0.0055 M was the focus of the work. Both HA
   and Ca(2+) adsorption were measured. To reveal molecular insight into
   the interactions between HA, Ca(2+) and montmorillonite, the HA
   concentration was related to the molar amount of its acidic functional
   groups. Adsorptive fractionation of HA was characterized using
   spectrophotometric parameters (SUVA(254), E(3)/E(4) and E(4)/E(6)). The
   fourfold increase in Ca loading resulted in more than ten times greater
   HA adsorption, but only three times greater Ca(2+) adsorption, during
   which the distribution between the solid and liquid phases changed
   considerably. The dominant processes were preferential Na(+)/Ca(2+) ion
   exchange and complexation by HA both in the aqueous phase and on
   montmorillonite (through Ca bridges on the faces and directly on Al-OH
   sites at the edges), causing adsorptive fractionation of organic matter
   and leaving the small, less humified HA fraction in the aqueous phase.

AB Charge state and particle network formation were studied at pH 6-6.5 in
   model systems containing montmorillonite, humic acid (HA) and calcium
   ions (Ca2+), which are responsible for microaggregate formation in
   soils. Since dispersing and aggregation of particles are governed by the
   composition of the coating layer on particle surfaces, the interfacial
   equilibria for the same systems were studied in Part I. Here, the
   composition of the systems was based on the HA and Ca2+ adsorption
   results using a meaningful HA concentration unit related to the molar
   amount of its acidic functional groups. Approaching real conditions, the
   effect of Ca loading was also studied at low and high HA content,
   representing the colloid fractions of soil poor (similar to 0.5%) and
   rich (similar to 5%) in organic matter. The zeta potential was measured
   and the structure of dense suspensions was characterized using rheology.
   HA addition breaks down the shear-tolerant structure of the particle
   network forming in montmorillonite suspensions at pH similar to 6.5.
   Suspensions become liquefied due to the dispersing effect of the HA.
   However, a much stronger structure can build up, if both HA and Ca2+ are
   present in optimal ratio, which can be readily estimated from the charge
   balance between negative charges (cation exchange sites on
   montmorillonite and acidic groups of HA) and positive charges of Ca2+.
   On the other hand, zeta potential determination did not support these
   changes, except the dispersing effect of HA. The strengthening of the
   particle network was quantified using the Bingham yield values. With
   increasing Ca loading, an almost fivefold increase in shear tolerance
   could be attained in HA-rich suspensions vs. those without HA or with
   low HA content. The aggregation of mineral particles is enhanced by the
   joint effect of HA and Ca2+. The higher the OM content, the more the Ca
   loading is expected to reach optimal aggregation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effects of orthophosphate on the adsorption of natural organic
   matter (NOM) on aluminum hydroxide were investigated using three organic
   compounds as surrogates, including humic acid (HA), phthalic acid, and
   2,3-clihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DIABA). The adsorption of phthalic acid
   and 2,3-DHBA was very limited compared to that of HA, whereas their
   adsorption was reduced Much more significantly than that of HA by
   phosphate. The efficiency of phosphate in reducing HA adsorption
   increased with increasing phosphate concentration. Phosphate adsorption
   was slightly reduced by plithalic acid and 2,3-DHBA but moderately
   Suppressed by HA. The adjacent carboxylic groups mainly contributed to
   the adsorption Of humic acid at low pH. while the adjacent phenol groups
   were responsible for the adsorption Of humic acid at high pH. HPLC-SEC
   and SUVA analysis revealed that HA molecules with high Molecular Weight
   were adsorbed preferentially but were easily displaced by the
   specifically adsorbed phosphate. TM-AFM images revealed that the
   aggregation of HA molecules and the protonation of carboxylic groups at
   41 low pH facilitated the adsorption under acidic conditions. The
   presence of phosphate increases the coagulant dosage for NOM removal as
   some sites oil the coagulant precipitates become utilized by phosphate.

AB The early stage aggregation kinetics of bare and alginate-coated
   hematite nanoparticles are acquired through time-resolved dynamic light
   scattering (DILS). Varying concentrations of monovalent (NaCl) and
   divalent (MgCl2 and CaCl2) electrolytes are employed to induce
   aggregation. In the presence of NaCl and MgCl2,the alginate-coated
   hematite nanoparticles undergo aggregation through electrostatic
   destabilization as described by the classic
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. This is ascertained
   through examination of the favorable and unfavorable regimes of the
   stability curves depicting the attachment efficiency as a function of
   salt concentration. Additional evidence may be found in the aggregation
   kinetics of alginate-coated particles, which under favorable aggregation
   conditions, are reasonably close to that of bare hematite nanoparticles.
   However, in the presence of CaCl2,the aggregate growth rate of
   alginate-coated hematite nanoparticles is much higher than that which
   conventional diffusive aggregation predicts. Dispersed hematite primary
   particles and lower-order aggregates enmeshed within extended alginate
   gel networks were observed under transmission electron microscope (TEM).
   The proposed mechanism for enhanced aggregation suggests an apparent
   increase in the collision radii of alginate coated hematite
   nanoparticles through alginate gel network formation from the particle
   surface. Additionally, cross-linking between unadsorbed (suspended)
   alginate macromolecules may form bridges between hematite-alginate gel
   clusters. It is further established that the presence of background
   electrolyte NaCl in solution is detrimental to the calcium-induced
   enhanced aggregation.

AB The pH-dependent adsorption of humic acid (HA) on magnetite and its
   effect on the surface charging and the aggregation of oxide particles
   were investigated. HA was extracted from brown coal. Synthetic magnetite
   was prepared by alkaline hydrolysis of iron(II) and iron(III) salts. The
   pH-dependent particle charge and aggregation, and coagulation kinetics
   at pH similar to 4 were measured by laser Doppler electrophoresis and
   dynamic light scattering. The charge of pure magnetite reverses from
   positive to negative at pH similar to 8, which may consider as
   isoelectric point (IEP). Near this pH, large aggregates form, while
   stable sols exist further from it. In the presence of increasing HA
   loading, the IEP shifts to lower pH, then at higher loading, magnetite
   becomes negatively charged even at low pHs, which indicate the
   neutralization and gradual recharging positive charges on surface. In
   acidic region, the trace HA amounts are adsorbed on magnetite surface as
   oppositely charged patches, systems become highly unstable due to
   heterocoagulation. Above the adsorption saturation, however, the
   nanoparticles are stabilized in a way of combined steric and
   electrostatic effects. The HA coated magnetite particles form stable
   colloidal dispersion, particle aggregation does not occur in a wide
   range of pH and salt tolerance is enhanced. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

AB The molecular mechanism of montmorillonite flocculation by bacterial
   polysaccharides was investigated, with special emphasis on the effect of
   carboxylic charges in the macromolecules on the mechanisms of
   interaction with the clay surface. An indirect way to quantify the
   energy of interaction was used, by comparing the flocculation ability of
   variously acidic poly saccharides. Data on tensile strength of
   aggregates in diluted suspension were collected by timed size
   measurements in the domain 0.1-600 mu m, using laser diffraction. The
   flow behavior of settled aggregates was studied by theology
   measurements. Flocculation of colloidal clay suspension by
   polysaccharides requires canceling of the electrostatic repulsions by
   salts, which allows approach of clay surfaces close enough to be bridged
   by adsorbing macromolecules. The amount of acidic charges of the
   polysaccharides, and especially their location in the molecular
   structure, governs the bridging mechanism and the resulting tensile
   strength of the aggregates. The exposure of carboxylate groups located
   on side chains strongly promotes flocculation. In turn, charges located
   on the backbone of the polysaccharide are less accessible to
   interaction, and the flocculation ability of such polysaccharides is
   lowered. Measurements at different pH indicate that adsorption of acidic
   polysaccharides occurs via electrostatic interactions on the amphoteric
   edge surface of clay platelets, whereas neutral polysaccharides rather
   adsorb via weak interactions. Increased tensile strength in diluted
   aggregates due to strong surface interactions results in proportionally
   increased viscosity of the concentrated aggregates. (c) 2004 Elsevier

AB Batch sorption experiments with peat humic acid (PHA) were carried out
   with two types of clay minerals (kaolinite and montmorillonite) under
   various solution conditions to determine the influence of solution
   chemistry (e.g. ionic strength, pH and solution cation) and mineralogy
   on PHA sorption to mineral surfaces. Consistent with contemporary
   studies, PHA sorption increased with increasing ionic strength and
   decreasing pH, and the presence of the background electrolyte Ca2+
   largely enhanced sorption in comparison to Na+. An attempt was made to
   separate the contributions of various modes of interactions to PHA
   sorption in our experiments, where ligand exchange was estimated to
   account for approximately 32% of PHA sorption on clay surfaces, van der
   Waals 22% and cation bridging 41% when Ca2+ was the background
   electrolyte. Kaolinite displayed higher adsorption for PHA than
   montmorillonite under the same solution conditions, which is explained
   by selective sorption of PHA by different clays and different binding
   mechanisms. H-1 High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning (HR-MAS) NMR was
   employed to examine the chemical nature of mineral-bound PHA. By
   employing 1H NMR techniques, direct evidence for the selective sorption
   of CH, groups and proteins on clay mineral surfaces was obtained.
   Montmorillonite displayed a higher uptake of aromatics and proteins
   while more CH2 groups were observed to sorb to kaolinite surfaces. (c)

AB The stability and aggregation behavior of iron oxide colloids in natural
   waters play an important role in controlling the fate, transport, and
   bioavailability of trace metals. Time-resolved dynamic light scattering
   experiments were carried out in a study of the aggregation kinetics and
   aggregate structure of natural organic matter (NOM) coated hematite
   colloids and bare hematite colloids. The aggregation behavior was
   examined over a range of solution chemistries, by adjusting the
   concentration of the supporting electrolyte-NaCl, CaCl2, or simulated
   seawater. With the solution pH adjusted so that NOM-coated and bare
   hematite colloids were at the same zeta potential, we observed a
   significant difference in colloid stability which results from the
   stability imparted to the colloids by the adsorbed NOM macromolecules.
   This enhanced stability of NOM-coated hematite colloids was not observed
   with CaCl2. Aggregate form expressed as fractal dimension was determined
   for both NOM-coated and bare hematite aggregates in both NaCl and CaCl2.
   The fractal dimensions of aggregates formed in the diffusion-limited
   regime indicate slightly more loosely packed aggregates for bare
   hematite than theory predicts. For NOM-coated hematite, a small decrease
   in fractal dimension was observed when the solution composition changed
   from NaCl to CaCl2. For systems in the reaction-limited regime, the
   measured fractal dimensions agreed with those in the literature. Colloid
   aggregation was also studied in synthetic seawater, a mixed cation
   system to simulate estuarine mixing. Those results describe the
   important phenomena of iron oxide aggregation and sedimentation in
   estuaries. When compared to field data from the Mullica Estuary, U.S.A.,
   it is shown that collision efficiency is a good predictor of the iron
   removal in this natural system.

AB Aggregation and dispersion of mineral particles spontaneously take place
   under changing environmental conditions in natural systems. The
   structure of particle network in soils, the retardation or release of
   colloidal particles, and their mobility and transport are inherently
   influenced by natural organic matter bound to the mineral matrix. Since
   the surface properties of clay mineral and metal oxide particles, and
   the electrified mineral-water interfaces play a major role in formation,
   structure and strength of aggregates, any surface modification,
   especially by polyanionic organic complexants such as humic substances,
   has a significant affect on particle interaction in a mineral
   assemblage. The permanently and/or conditionally charged clay minerals
   (montmorillonite and kaolinite) and iron oxides (hematite and
   magnetite), as known major mineral components in natural waters, were
   selected for studying their surface charge characteristics and pH
   dependent interactions. We discuss how the surface charge correlates
   with particle aggregation through some characteristic examples for homo
   and heterocoagulation of similar and dissimilar mineral particles under
   acidic condition (at pH similar to4) in the dilute and concentrated
   systems studied by means of light scattering and theology, respectively.
   The adsorption of a brown coal derived humic acid, and its influence on
   the surface charge character and particle aggregation of clay and iron
   oxide particles were also studied in dilute and concentrated
   suspensions. Humic acids can be bound to the most reactive surface sites
   of clay and oxide particles, i.e. to Al-OH mainly at the edges of clay
   lamellae, and to Fe-OH on iron oxides, in surface complexation reaction,
   therefore their role in particle aggregation is specific. Relations
   between surface complexation, surface charge modification, and particle
   aggregation in pure and mixed montmorillonite-iron oxide systems are
   explained. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ionic strength dependence of humic acid (HA) adsorption on magnetite
   (Fe3O4) was investigated at pH similar to5, similar to8 and similar to9,
   where variable charged magnetite is positive, neutral and negative,
   respectively. The adsorption studies revealed that HA has high affinity
   to magnetite surface especially at lower pH, where interacting partners
   have opposite charges. However, in spite of electrostatic repulsion at
   pH similar to9 notable amounts of humate are adsorbed. Increasing ionic
   strength enhances HA adsorption at each pH due to charge screening. The
   dominant interaction is probably a ligand-exchange reaction,
   nevertheless the Coulombic contribution to the organic matter
   accumulation on oxide surface is also significant under acidic
   condition. The results from size exclusion chromatography demonstrate
   that the smaller size HA fractions enriched with functional groups are
   adsorbed preferentially on the surface of magnetite at pH similar to8 in
   dilute NaCl solution. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work deals with the effect of humic acid (HA) adsorption on the
   interfacial properties, the stability, and the rheology of aqueous iron
   oxide (hematite) suspensions. It is first of all demonstrated that HA
   effectively adsorbs onto hematite, mainly at acid pH. Since the charge
   of the HA chains is negative, it will be electrostatically attracted to
   the hematite surface below the point of zero charge of the particles,
   when they are positively charged. Electrophoresis measurements of
   hematite suspensions as a function of pH in the presence and absence of
   HA clearly demonstrate the adsorption of negatively charged entities on
   the oxide. Since the HA-covered particles can be thought of as "soft"
   colloids, Ohshima's theory was used to gain information on the surface
   potential and the charge density of the HA layer (H. Ohshima, in: A.V.
   Delgado (Ed.), Interfacial Electrokinetics and Electrophoresis, Dekker,
   New York, 2002, p. 123). A different procedure was also used to
   ascertain the degree of modification experienced by the hematite surface
   when placed in contact with HA solutions. The contact angles of selected
   liquids on pretreated hematite layers lead to the conclusion that the
   humic acid molecules impart to the particles a significant
   electron-donor character, in turn increasing their hydrophilicity. All
   this amount of information is used in the work for the interpretation of
   the rheological properties of hematite suspensions; the results are
   consistent with a stabilizing effect of HA adsorption on the
   suspensions, mainly as a consequence of the increased electrostatic
   repulsion between particles. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We studied the flocculation kinetics and structure of hematite
   aggregates induced by a large rigid extracellular polysaccharide,
   schizophyllan. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force
   microscopy (AFM), photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), and static
   light scattering (SLS) were used to characterize hematite particles,
   schizophyllan chains, and their flocs, to follow the time evolution of
   floc sizes, and to determine floc fractal dimensions. A maximum
   flocculation rate was found at a certain schizophyllan/hematite ratio.
   The maximum rate was considerably smaller than the rate of
   diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) of hematite particles induced by
   simple electrolytes. To interpret the experimental results and to reveal
   various factors affecting the optimal dosage, Monte Carlo simulations
   were performed on the flocculation of small colloidal particles by
   relatively long, monodisperse linear polymers. The existence of the
   maximum flocculation rate was confirmed by computer simulation. However,
   a higher optimal dosage of schizophyllan was obtained in the
   experiments. The difference in the optimal dosage can be attributed
   mostly to the higher adsorption affinity of the hematite on
   schizophyllan aggregates present in the initial solution and the
   presence of a large fraction of free polymer chains which do not
   participate in the flocculation process. Both experiments and computer
   simulations demonstrated the fractal nature of the
   schizophyllan-hematite flocs. The fractal dimensions of the flocs at the
   optimal dosage were determined. A higher fractal dimension was obtained
   from experiments than from computer simulations, suggesting a
   reconstruction of the floc structure. Finally, a two-stage flocculation
   mechanism for hematite particles in the presence of a relatively long
   schizophyllan polymer was proposed. In the first flocculation stage, the
   hematite particles are preferentially adsorbed onto the schizophyllan
   aggregates in solution. The second stage consists of the association of
   these reactive entities with each other and also with naked chains to
   form fractal flocs by a bridging mechanism, where the hematite particles
   play the role of ligands. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Molecular weight (MW) fractionation of Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA)
   and purified Aldrich humic acid (PAHA) by adsorption onto kaolinite and
   hematite was investigated in equilibrium and rate experiments with a
   size-exclusion chromatography system using ultraviolet (UV) light
   detection. The extent of adsorptive fractionation based on UV detection
   was positively correlated with the percent carbon adsorption for both
   humic substances (HS), although the specific fractionation pattern
   observed depended on the particular HS and mineral used. Higher MW
   fractions of SRFA, an aquatic HS, were preferentially adsorbed to both
   kaolinite and hematite whereas the fractionation trends for PAHA, a
   terrestrial peat HS, differed for the two minerals. The contrasting
   fractionation patterns for SRFA versus PAHA can be explained reasonably
   well by the different structural trends that occur in their respective
   MW fractions and the underlying adsorption processes. Rate studies of
   adsorptive fractionation revealed an initial rapid uptake of smaller HS
   molecules by the mineral surfaces, followed by their replacement at the
   surface by a much slower uptake of the larger HS molecules present in
   aqueous solution. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Under natural conditions, the adsorption of ions at the solid-water
   interface may be strongly influenced by the adsorption of organic
   matter. In this paper, we describe the adsorption of fulvic acid (FA) by
   metal (hydr)oxide surfaces with a heterogeneous surface complexation
   model, the ligand and charge distribution (LCD) model. The model is a
   self-consistent combination of the nonideal competitive adsorption
   (NICA) equation and the CD-MUSIC model. The LCD model can describe
   simultaneously the concentration, pH, and salt dependency of the
   adsorption with a minimum of only three adjustable parameters.
   Furthermore, the model predicts the coadsorption of protons accurately
   for an extended range of conditions. Surface speciation calculations
   show that almost all hydroxyl groups of the adsorbed FA molecules are
   involved in outer sphere complexation reactions. The carboxylic groups
   of the adsorbed FA molecule form inner and outer sphere complexes.
   Furthermore, part of the carboxylate groups remain noncoordinated and
   deprotonated. Copyright (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The role of humic acid in the transport of negatively charged colloids
   through porous media was examined. Adsorption of humic acid on latex
   colloids and silica collectors reduced the deposition of suspended
   particles and enhanced the reentrainment of deposited particles in
   porous media. These effects are considered to arise from additional
   electrostatic and steric contributions to the repulsive interaction
   energy due to the adsorption of negatively charged humic acid on both
   the suspended particles and the media collectors. At low ionic strength
   reversible deposition in shallow secondary minima is hypothesized to be
   the principal attachment mechanism, independent of the presence of humic
   acid. It is proposed that, under these solution conditions, particle
   deposition and reentrainment are the result of a dynamic process, in
   which particles are continuously captured and released from secondary
   minima. At higher ionic strengths, deposition may be regarded as a
   combination of two mechanisms: capture in the primary well and capture
   in the secondary minimum. Theoretical calculations of the attachment
   efficiency were conducted using two existing mathematical models. The
   first model is based on deposition in the primary well (interaction
   force boundary layer, IFBL), and the second model is based on the
   Maxwell kinetic theory and deposition in the secondary minimum (Maxwell
   model). Simulations conducted with the Maxwell model provide
   significantly better fits of the experimental results than those
   conducted with the IFBL model.

AB To evaluate the risk of contaminant transport by mobile colloids, it
   seems essential to understand how colloids and associated pollutants
   behave during their migration through uncontaminated soil or
   groundwater. In this study, we investigated at pH 4 the influence of
   flow velocity, humic acid, solution Ca2+ concentrations, and trace
   metals (Pb2+, Cu2+) on the transport and deposition of kaolinite
   particles through a pure crystalline quartz sand as porous medium. A
   short-pulse chromatographic technique was used to measure colloid
   deposition. Adsorption of humic acid to the kaolinite increase its
   negative surface charge and then decrease colloid deposition.
   Experiments with different flow rates showed that humic-coated kaolinite
   colloid deposition followed a first-order kinetic rate law. The
   deposition rate coefficients of humic-coated kaolinite colloids increase
   with increasing Ca2+ concentration in the suspension. The effect of
   trace metals on the mobility is studied by injecting two suspensions
   with different concentrations of Pb2+ and Cu2+. At very low cation
   concentration, the fraction of colloids retained is low and roughly
   independent of the nature of divalent cations. At high concentration,
   the deposition is higher and depends on the affinity of divalent cations
   toward humic-coated kaolinite colloids. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

AB We report the separate and combined effects of humic acid and Ca2+ ions
   on the transport of colloidal particles through a sand-packed column.
   Polystyrene latex particles with a sulfate functional group were used as
   model colloids. The concentrations of both the inlet solution and the
   effluent solutions were measured during each experimental run.
   Breakthrough curves were obtained by taking the ratios of each effluent
   sample concentration to the inlet solution concentration. In the absence
   of humic acid, the results indicate that increasing the concentration of
   Ca2+ increases particle attachment to the sand, thus causing decreased
   transport rates of latex particles through the porous bed matrix. Once 4
   mg/l humic acid was added to the system, changes were observed in the
   effect that Ca2+ has on latex particle breakthrough. In a system
   containing calcium, increasing the humic acid concentration was shown to
   reduce particle attachment and increase transport rates. In the absence
   of calcium, the ratios for the outlet-to-inlet concentrations were
   similar for each concentration of humic acid. The electrophoretic
   mobility was also measured in order to determine the role of
   electrostatic repulsion in the latex particle transport. The
   electrophoretic mobility of the latex particles was found to be
   dependent on humic acid concentration in the absence of Ca2+ but not in
   its presence.

   most abundant intermediate molecular weight (IMW) fraction (1250-3750
   Da) fit the Langmuir adsorption equation, as is commonly observed for
   humic substances. However, this overall fit masked the non-langmuir

   fractions. We observed preferential adsorption of HMW fractions at low
   pH and of IMW fractions at higher pH. We also observed preferential
   adsorption of components with higher absorbance normalized to moles C
   (epsilon (280)), probably reflecting greater aromaticity. Over the first
   6 h of adsorption experiments, adsorbed organic carbon increased and
   weight average molecular weight (M-w) of the organic matter remaining in
   solution decreased, consistent with slower adsorption of higher
   molecular weight components. Observations of fractionation upon
   adsorption agreed well with a field study showing lower M-w and lower
   epsilon (280) organic matter in deeper ground water relative to surface
   and shallow ground water. Copyright (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In this research, the influence of two natural organic polymers
   (polysaccharide and humic acid) on the stability of colloidal aggregates
   was examined. The primary objective of this research was to determine
   whether addition of organic matter to flee suspensions results in the
   fragmentation or stabilization of aggregates. A second objective was to
   determine how the size of aggregates and the composition of organic
   matter influence the floc breakup or stabilization process. It was found
   that the stability of aggregates depended on the type of organic
   material present as well as hoc size. For example, humic acid increased
   the stability of aggregates more effectively than polysaccharides of
   larger size. It was also found that the addition of humic acid or
   polysaccharide generally decreased the rate of coagulation of small
   aggregates but had less influence on large aggregates. In no case did
   the addition of polysaccharide or humic acid result in the fragmentation
   of particle aggregates. The existence of strong interparticle forces
   within flocs prevented aggregate breakup upon adsorption of natural
   organic polymers. The results presented here provide important new
   information regarding the influence of NOM on the behavior of particles
   in aquatic systems. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Experiments were conducted to compare the affinity and reactivity of
   three different minerals for natural organic matter (NOM) in forest
   floor leachate (FFL) from hardwood and pine forests. The FFLs were
   acidic (pH 4) with ionic strengths of 1.4 mM (hardwood) and 1.1 mM
   (pine), and they contained larger organic molecules (weight average
   molecular weights [Mw] = 5-6 kDa) than has: been reported recently for
   surface waters using similar methods. A synthetic diluent solution was
   prepared to match the inorganic chemistry of the FFL and to provide a
   range of initial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (0-140 g
   C m(-3)) for reaction with goethite (alpha -FeOOH), birnessite (delta
   -MnO2) and smectite (montmorillonite, SWy-2) in suspension, and in
   corresponding blanks.
   A variety of macroscopic and spectroscopic methods were employed to show
   that reaction with the three minerals resulted in distinctly different
   NOM adsorption, fractionation and transformation patterns. Goethite
   exhibited a steep initial slope in the adsorption isotherm and a maximum
   retention of 10.5 g C kg(-1). The isotherm for montmorillonite was more
   linear, but equal amounts of C were adsorbed to goethite and
   montmorillonite (per unit sorbent mass) at maximum DOG. Whereas
   preferential uptake of high Mw, aromatic constituents via ligand
   exchange was observed for goethite, compounds of lower than average Mw
   were retained on montmorillonite: and no preference fur aromatic
   moieties was observed. Birnessite, which has an isoelectric point of pH
   < 2, retained low amounts of organic C (<2 g C kg(-1)) but exhibited the
   highest propensity for oxidative transformation of the NOM. The data
   indicate that fractionation behavior of NOM is dependent on mineral
   surface chemistry in addition to sorbent affinity fur organic C. This
   work also emphasizes the fact that abiotic transformation reactions must
   be considered in studies of NOM interaction with Fe(III) and Mn(IV)
   containing solid phases. Copyright (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Mineral-bound humic substances modify the surfaces of clay minerals.
   changing the nature and number of adsorption sites for contaminants. Due
   to their effect on the surface charge of colloidal particles they can
   also change the particles mobility and thus their transport behavior. In
   this paper the influence of natural organic matter on the zetapotential
   of kaolinite and montmorillonite is shown. Adsorption experiments with
   kaolinite and montmorillonite show that due to adsorption the humic
   substances are fractionated. The equilibrium pH value does not influence
   the fractionation due to adsorption. Large hydrophobic molecules showed
   the strongest affinity towards the clay surfaces. Substances with a
   small apparent molecular size and a high content of carboxylic
   functional groups made up the non-adsorbing fraction of the NOM. Ca2+
   had no measurable effect on the adsorption. The low influence of the
   adsorbed NOM on the zetapotential of the clay minerals suggests physical
   adsorption as the predominant adsorption mechanism. (C) 2000 Elsevier

AB The adsorption of fulvic acid by goethite was determined experimentally
   as a function of concentration, pH, and ionic strength. The data were
   described with the CD-MUSIC model of Hiemstra and Van Riemsdijk (1996),
   which allows the distribution of charge of the bound fulvate molecule
   over a surface region. Simultaneously, the concentration, pH, and salt
   dependency of the binding of fulvic acid can be described. Using the
   same parameters, the basic charging behavior of the goethite in the
   absence of fulvic acid could be described well. The surface species used
   in the model indicate that inner sphere coordination of carboxylic
   groups of the fulvate molecule is important at low pH, whereas at high
   pH the outer sphere coordination with reactive groups of the fulvate
   molecule with high proton affinity is important. Copyright (C) 1999

AB A conceptual model for the adsorption of linear, flexible weak
   polyelectrolytes on oxide surfaces is applied to the adsorption and
   conformation of natural organic matter (NOM) on hematite. The
   polyelectrolytic nature of NOM and the complexation (specific)
   interactions between the functional groups of NOM and oxide surface
   sites are taken into account in this model. Model results are compared
   with experimental data for adsorption of Suwannee River humic acid on
   hematite at different pHs and ionic strengths. When the initial surface
   charge of hematite is positive (termed the oppositely charged case), the
   experimental adsorption density and adsorbed hydrodynamic layer
   thickness decrease with increasing pH and with decreasing ionic
   strength. When the initial surface charge is negative (termed the
   similarly charged case), the experimental adsorption density decreases
   with increasing pH and the adsorbed hydrodynamic layer thickness
   increases with increasing pH. Model results with a reaction represented
   by >MeOH + L- = >MeOHL- agree with the experimental adsorption density
   and adsorbed hydrodynamic layer thickness for the oppositely charged
   case, and the adsorption density for the similarly charged case. This
   suggests that the adsorption of NOM on hematite is related to the
   polyelectrolytic nature of NOM and to the complexation interactions
   between the neutral surface sites of oxides and the deprotonated
   functional groups of NOM. The effects of solution chemistry on the
   adsorption of NOM are due to a great extent to its effects on surface
   and NOM speciation, which can influence the specific interactions
   between NOM and surface sites. Model calculations also indicate that for
   the oppositely charged case, the adsorbed NOM overcompensates for the
   positive charge of the hematite surface. Simulations of electric
   potential and volume fraction indicate an interrelationship between the
   adsorption of NOM and interfacial properties. Copyright (C) 1999

   acids are adsorbed onto 6 nm compared to 16 nn nanocrystalline titania
   particles. A Langmuir adsorption model modified to include the

   The increase in K-ads arises predominantly from the increased

AB Natural organic matter (NOM) consists of a complex mixture of organic
   molecules; previous studies have suggested that preferential sorption of
   higher molecular weight, more hydrophobic, and more aromatic components
   may lead to fractionation of the NOM pool upon passage through porous
   media. Our work expands upon previous studies by quantifying the change
   in solution-phase weight average molecular weight (M-w) upon sorption of
   bulk (rather than isolated) surface water NOM from the Suwannee River
   (SR) and the Great Dismal Swamp (GDS) to goethite and kaolinite at
   different sorption densities and at pH 4, 22 degrees C. High pressure
   size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was used to quantify changes in
   M-w upon sorption, and molar absorptivities at lambda = 280 nm were used
   to approximate changes in solution NOM aromaticity. Two SR water samples
   were used, with M-w = 2320 and 2200 Da; a single GDS sample was used,
   with M-w = 1890 Da. The SR NOM was slightly more hydrophobic and
   aromatic. These differences were reflected in greater sorption of SR NOM
   than GDS NOM. Both surface water NOMs showed a much greater affinity for
   goethite than for kaolinite. HPSEC analysis of the NOM remaining in
   solution after 24 h reaction time with goethite revealed that the
   largest changes in solution phase M(w)s (decreases by 900-1700 Da)
   occurred at relatively low equilibrium sorbate concentrations
   (approximately 5-20 mg C 1(-1)); the decrease in solution M-w suggested
   that reactive surface sites were occupied disproportionately by large
   and intermediate size NOM moieties. At higher equilibrium NOM
   concentrations (> 20 mg C 1(-1)), as percent adsorption decreased, M-w
   in solution was similar to original samples. A smaller decrease in
   solution NOM M-w (300-500 Da at 10-20 mg C 1(-1) similar to 100 Da at >
   20 mg) also occurred upon sorption to kaolinite. Overall, our results
   showed that factors las related to NOM composition, clay mineral surface
   properties, and position along the sorption isotherm) which promote a
   higher percent sorption lead to the most pronounced decreases in
   solution M-w. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Precipitation and aggregation of metacinnabar (black HgS) was inhibited
   in the presence of low concentrations (greater than or equal to 3 mg
   C/L) of humic fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolated from
   the Florida Everglades. At low Hg concentrations (less than or equal to
   5 x 10(-8) M), DOM prevented the precipitation of metacinnabar. At
   moderate Hg concentrations (5 x 10(-5) M), DOM inhibited the aggregation
   of colloidal metacinnabar (Hg passed through a 0.1 mu m filter but was
   removed by centrifugation). At Hg concentrations greater than 5 x 10(-4)
   M, mercury formed solid metacinnabar particles that were removed from
   solution by a 0.1 mu m filter. Organic matter rich in aromatic moieties
   was preferentially removed with the solid. Hydrophobic organic acids
   (humic and fulvic acids) inhibited aggregation better than hydrophilic
   organic acids. The presence of chloride, acetate, salicylate, EDTA, and
   cysteine did not inhibit the precipitation or aggregation of
   metacinnabar. Calcium enhanced metacinnabar aggregation even in the
   presence of DOM, but the magnitude of the effect was dependent on the
   concentrations of DOM, Hg, and Ca. Inhibition of metacinnabar
   precipitation appears to be a result of strong DOM-Hg binding.
   Prevention of aggregation of colloidal particles appears to be caused by
   adsorption of DOM and electrostatic repulsion.

AB Adsorption equilibria were studied with RO isolates for both activated
   carbon and activated alumina. Maximum carbon loadings on the order of 65
   mg/g DOC were obtained, while the maximum loadings of activated alumina
   were about 30 mg/g DOG. In the latter case the slope of the isotherms
   was generally steeper, indicating weaker adsorbabilities of some of the
   NOM compounds on the metal oxide adsorbent. Since NOM must be regarded
   as a multi-component system with respect to adsorption, the data were
   evaluated by the adsorption analysis procedure. The results were used
   for a theoretical comparison of NOM adsorption based on the same initial
   concentration of all samples. The method of colloidal titration was
   applied to the RO isolates in the range pH = 3-8. Poly-DADMAC was used
   as a cationic polymer, and a streaming current instrument was used for
   end point detection. The results which are termed anionic colloidal
   charge (ACC) values increase with increasing pH for pH = 3-6 while they
   are about constant for pH = 6-8. At the samples' original pH, the
   specific ACC values found range from 5.2 to 7.6 meq/g DOG. Mass transfer
   coefficients for NOM adsorption on granular activated carbon were
   determined for both RO and EVAP isolates, respectively. The data were
   used to derive effective diffusivities for each sample. The results
   differ by a factor of about 2 with the Maridalsvann sample having the
   highest and the Humex sample having the lowest diffusivity. Furthermore,
   the results for the EVAP isolates are in 8 of 9 cases higher than for
   the RO samples. Based on a comparison with known macromolecules, average
   molecular weight values were estimated to be on the order of 700-4800
   Dalton. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The adsorption of humic acid to mineral particles can be characterized
   by specific and electrostatic interactions and by adsorption
   fractionation. In this paper we focus on adsorption fractionation and
   the influence of the polydispersity (with respect to size) of humic
   acids on the adsorption process and the shape of the isotherms at
   different pH values. In the previous paper the effects of electrostatic
   interactions were described. The adsorption from a mixture of two humic
   substances, purified Aldrich humic acid (PAHA) and Laurentian fulvic
   acid, on nonporous hematite is studied. It is shown that, in time, the
   large humic acid molecules replace the readily adsorbed, small, fulvic
   acid molecules. Preferential adsorption of large humic molecules over
   small ones also affects the shape of the adsorption isotherm of a single
   humic acid. After a high affinity start, the adsorbed amount of PAHA
   gradually increases with increasing humic acid concentration. This is
   mainly due to an increasing adsorption fractionation. For a certain
   concentration in solution the effect of the fractionation increases with
   increasing adsorbed amounts. This explains why for PAHA the
   polydispersity effect is much stronger at pH 4 than at pH 9 where the
   adsorption is lower. To obtain a general impression of the effects of
   polydispersity on the adsorption of weak polyelectrolytes on a variably
   charged surface, calculations are presented using a
   self-consistent-field theory. The calculated adsorption of a mixture of
   two acidic polyelectrolytes, that (mainly) differ in size, onto an
   oppositely charged hematite type surface confirm the trends found for
   humics: adsorption fractionation occurs, and the effect of the
   fractionation on the isotherm increases with decreasing pH. The
   calculations also show that the area-to-volume ratio affects the
   isotherm and results in an adsorption/desorption hysteresis.

AB Time-resolved dynamic light scattering was used to investigate the
   influence of pH and adsorbed humic acid on the coagulation kinetics of
   kaolinite clay colloids. Stability ratios, defined as the experimental
   fast coagulation rate divided by the coagulation rate of the sample
   under consideration, were determined from the initial increases in
   average hydrodynamic radius with time. Pure kaolinite exhibited fast
   coagulation (stability ratio W = 1) at all ionic strengths (0.001 to 1 M
   NaClO4) when suspension pH was below 5.8. Above pH 5.8, coagulation
   rates were significantly reduced (W > 1) and W exhibited pronounced
   ionic strength dependence. The observed behavior is explained by
   edge-to-face heterocoagulation by electrostatic attractive forces at low
   pH and electrostatic stabilization at high pH. The transition in
   coagulation behavior occurs at the point of zero charge (PZC) of the
   kaolinite edge surfaces near pH 5.8. Small additions of humic acid at pH
   4 resulted in edge charge reversal from positive to negative and
   substantially reduced coagulation rates (W > 1); similar behavior was
   observed at pH 6. Relating the observed stability ratios W to zeta
   potentials suggests that at low to medium ionic strength (less than or
   equal to 0.01 M NaClO4) the stabilizing effect of adsorbed humic acid is
   purely electrostatic. However, at high ionic strength (greater than or
   equal to 0.1 M) steric stabilization may also play a role. (C) 1998

AB The adsorption of humic acid to mineral particles can be characterized
   by specific and electrostatic interactions and by polydispersity
   effects. In this paper we focus on the adsorbed amount and discuss the
   importance of specific and electrostatic interactions. The adsorption of
   purified Aldrich humic acid onto hematite has been measured as a
   function of pH and salt concentration as well as in the presence of two
   cadmium concentrations. Besides the adsorbed amount, the thickness of
   the adsorbed layer has also been studied. The experimental results are
   discussed in relation to the polyelectrolyte behavior of the humic acid.
   At high pH and low salt concentration the adsorption is low and the
   humic acid molecules are adsorbed relatively flat on the surface. At low
   pH and high salt concentration a substantial fraction of the adsorbed
   humic acid is not in direct contact with the surface, which results in a
   relatively high adsorbed amount and a large layer thickness. PAHA
   adsorption at not too low pH leads to an overcompensation of the
   hematite charge and to the development of an electrostatic barrier
   against further adsorption. Substantial PAHA adsorption occurs at the
   point of zero charge of hematite; this shows that besides electrostatic
   interactions also specific interactions are important. Calculations
   based on the SCF theory for polyelectrolyte adsorption show that the
   trends with respect to the adsorbed amounts and layer thickness as a
   function of pH and salt concentration correspond well with the measured
   trends for PAHA. This suggest that at least partly the humic acid
   adsorption behavior is related to its polyelectrolyte character. Both
   experiments and theory indicate that a well-developed layer arises upon
   adsorption and that lateral interactions within this layer determine to
   a large extent the adsorption process.

   colloids was studied by means of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.
   The short-range mechanism of this technique was applied in the
   determination of the chemical groups which are directly attached to the

   sensitive to pH, to the electric charge of both the humic substances and
   the metallic surface, and to the size of the adsorbed macromolecules.
   From the obtained results, a model for the adsortion mechanism of these

   variation of their electric charge on modifying the pH. FTIR spectra of
   some of the extracted fractions and SERS spectra of o-, m-, and

   were also obtained in order to better attribute the SERS spectra of

AB The adsorption of Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) and a synthetic
   organic polymer, polymaleic acid (PMA) by goethite was studied. The
   adsorption density of the sorbates decreased with increasing pH, and the
   data could best be described by the Langmuir adsorption equation. The
   number- and weight-averaged molecular weights, M-w and M-n, of the
   sorbates in the solution phase before and after adsorption by goethite
   were measured by high-pressure size exclusion chromatography. The
   observed decreases in the M-n and M-w of SRFA in the solution phase
   after adsorption demonstrated that fractionation of SRFA on the basis of
   molecular size occured. UV molar absorptivities measured at 280 nm also
   decreased, which suggests that the more aromatic moieties are
   preferentially adsorbed. Potentiometric titrations conducted on SRFA
   revealed changes in the conditional acidity constants (expressed as the
   negative logarithm, pK(a)) of the fulvic acid after adsorption. The
   increased pK(a) value of the humic material remaining in the solution
   after adsorption implies that the strongly sorbing compounds possessed
   stronger acidic functional groups. Fractionation of PMA after
   adsorption, however, did not occur to the same extent compared to SRFA
   because PMA is relatively homogeneous. The experimental results confirm
   that molecular weight, aromaticity, and organic acidity are major
   factors controlling the fractionation of natural organic matter (NOM) by
   adsorption onto hydrous mineral oxides. PMA, a relatively uniform and
   less polydisperse organic polymer, may serve as an endmember material
   characteristic of NOM that exhibits the least amount of fractionation
   upon adsorption. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Organic matter has a great influence over the fate of inorganic colloids
   in surface waters, The chemical nature and structure of natural organic
   matter (NOM) will be an important factor in determining whether colloids
   will be stabilised or destabilised by NOM. Under environmentally
   relevant conditions, the ubiquitous fulvic acids are likely to be
   responsible for coating and imparting a negative charge to colloids, If
   the adsorbed polyelectrolyte coating produces an increase in absolute
   surface potential, it will act to stabilise colloids in the water
   column. On the other hand, colloidal organic carbon, especially
   chain-like structures, has been shown to be involved in the aggregation
   of inorganic colloids through the formation of bridges. It is highly
   probable that both adsorption and bridging flocculation are occurring
   simultaneously in the natural aquatic environment. The importance of
   each process depends directly on the nature and concentration of organic
   matter in the system and indirectly on the productivity of the lake, its
   hydrological pathways, temporal variations, temperature, etc. The
   present paper reports such results and emphasises the need to
   discriminate the different kinds of NOM. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Different organic compounds or fractions of natural organic matter (NOM)
   show different adsorption affinities (K) and capacities (qm) on mineral
   surfaces. We hypothesize that these different organic compounds or
   fractions compete for adsorption when surface adsorption sites are
   limited. In this study, competitive adsorption of binary mixtures of
   Suwannee River NOM (SR-NOM), polyacrylic acid (PAA), phthalic acid, and
   salicylic acid on iron oxide was investigated at a constant
   solid:solution ratio, temperature, and pressure, but at varying C weight
   fractions, pH, and solution concentrations of the mixture. Results
   revealed that, in general, PAA is the most competitive whereas SR-NOM is
   more competitive than phthalic and salicylic acids. The competitive
   adsorption of these organic compounds is pH-dependent. Ar pH < 4, PAA
   becomes less competitive than SR-NOM or phthalic and salicylic acids.
   The competition among these organic compounds may be related to their
   carboxyl functional groups and their molecular structure. The overall
   strong competitiveness of PAA at pH > 4 in comparison with other
   organics is attributed to its high carboxyl density and linear molecular
   structure, which promote strong surface complexation with iron oxide.
   Because of the heterogeneity or polydispersity of NOM, this research
   indicates that NOM partitioning and transport in the subsurface soil
   environment are influenced by the dynamic competitive interactions
   between NOM subcomponents (or fractions). This process ultimately
   influences the distribution, interaction, and cotransport of
   contaminants and mineral colloids that are associated with NOM.

AB Adsorption of natural organic matter (NOM) onto particles contributes to
   their colloidal stability and inhibits coagulation in water treatment.
   Ozone has been shown to assist in the destabilization of particles
   during water treatment by several hypothesized mechanisms. The goal of
   this research was to study the effects of ozone on NOM-coated particles
   in model (synthetic) waters to determine prevailing mechanisms and to
   quantify the effects of different variables. The experimental system
   included particles, aqueous phase NOM in equilibrium with particle phase
   (sorbed) NOM, and a background solution chemistry reflecting pH, ionic
   strength, and potentially influential ions (e.g., calcium, bicarbonate).
   Particle stability was assessed through electrophoretic mobility
   measurements while particle aggregation was assessed through use of a
   collision efficiency factor (a) under fluid shear mixing conditions.
   Changes in molecular weight, acidity, and complexation capacity of NOM
   (aqueous and mineral-bound) with calcium was studied before and after
   ozonation. Oxalic acid was used as a model compound for ozonated NOM. It
   was found that ozone-induced particle destabilization occurred only in
   the presence of calcium. Based on the overall results, it is proposed
   that the ozone-induced particle destabilization observed in our system
   (with calcium present) is due to the following: (a) an increase in
   calcium association with ozonated NOM constituents thereby inhibiting
   adsorption of anionic species onto the alumina surface and (b) a
   production of more ligand sites by ozone on the surface-sorbed NOM
   leading to increased NOM complexation with calcium. These effects lead
   to a reduction in particle stability through surface charge reduction.

AB Photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) has been employed to monitor the
   size evolution of aggregates of hematite particles in the presence of
   fairly monodisperse polyacrylic acid (PAA). The aggregation rate
   increases to a maximum value and then decreases as the PAA concentration
   is increased. This stability variation results mainly from a charge
   reversal of polymer coated particles, as revealed by electrophoretic
   mobility measurements. The maximum rate, occurring at low magnitudes of
   zeta potentials, is found to be identical to that induced by KCl above
   the critical coagulation concentration. Thus, it seems that polymer
   bridging is not important compared to the charge neutralization
   mechanism in the diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) regime. Dynamic
   scaling yields the same fractal dimension for DLA aggregates induced by
   both PAA and KCI. This suggests that the polymer chains situated between
   contacting particles in an aggregate completely collapse on the surface
   so that the interparticle distance hardly increases in the presence of a
   flexible polyelectrolyte. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.

AB Column filtration experiments were conducted to determine the deposition
   kinetics of the humic matter-coated hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) colloids on
   quartz grains in the presence of Ca2+. Three well-characterized humic
   substances were used. Our results indicate that several mechanisms are
   responsible for the differences in the attachment efficiencies of these
   particles. The relative importance of each mechanism varies depending
   upon the type of humic matter used. Systems coated with the peat humic
   acid, which is the least acidic, the most hydrophobic and has the
   highest molecular size of all the samples used here, had the highest
   stability at approximately [Ca2+] < 0.002 M, despite their lower
   electrophoretic mobilities. This behavior may be attributed to the
   greater electrosteric interactions brought about by the adsorbed humic
   acid. At higher Ca2+ concentrations, however, the stability of the peat
   humic acid-coated systems was drastically reduced owing to the effect of
   cation bridging and/or hydrophobic interactions. Our experimental set up
   does not allow unequivocal determination of the underlying cause of the
   observed differences between the attachment efficiencies of the
   particles coated with the two fulvic acids used here. Such differences
   may be controlled by electrostatic, hydrophobic or electrosteric
   interactions, or a complex combination of these.

AB Natural organic matter (NOM) is a complex mixture of different organic
   components (or fractions), yet few studies have examined the fractional
   adsorption of NOM on mineral surfaces.  In this study, we fractionated
   NOM into hydrophobic (HbA) and hydrophilic (HL) subcomponents and two
   size fractions (with nominal molecular weights cut off at 3000 (3 K)
   dalton in an attempt to elucidate the adsorption and desorption
   mechanisms of NOM on iron oxide surfaces.  Results indicated that, on a
   C weight basis, larger size HbA fraction was preferentially adsorbed
   (with a higher adsorption affinity and capacity) over smaller size HL
   fraction.  However, on an O weight basis, less HbA fraction was adsorbed
   relative to the HL fraction, because HbA contained about 1.34 times more
   C but 0.82 times less O than the HL.  These observations are consistent
   with results which indicate that only limited adsorption sites are
   available on the iron oxide surfaces and that the mechanism of HbA and
   HL adsorption was dominated by surface complexation-ligand exchange. 
   FTIR and NMR spectroscopy and studies with several substituted benzoic
   acids/phenols further indicated that carboxyl and hydroxyl functional
   groups of these NOM fractions were actively involved in the reactions,
   and the steric arrangement of these functional groups may have played an
   important role in determining the adsorption of NOM fractions. 
   Desorption studies indicated that the adsorbed NOM macromolecules on
   iron oxide surfaces were strongly bound at a given pH and ionic
   composition, resulting in a strong adsorption-desorption hysteresis. 
   One possible explanation for the observed hysteresis is that the
   solution composition and equilibria are not identical between adsorption
   and desorption phases of the experiment because of preferential or
   selective adsorption of certain NOM fractions.  This study implies that,
   due to the polydispersity of NOM, the competitive and fractional
   adsorption-desorption of NOM subcomponents must be considered in order
   to better predict NOM partitioning between the solution and solid
   phases, and, therefore, the transport behavior of NOM in the subsurface
   soil environment.

AB Using a particle counter technique, we investigated the fragmentation
   process of aggregates of polystyrene sulfonate latices induced by the
   adsorption of polyvinylpyridine at the particle-liquid interface by
   determining the aggregate size distribution c(x, t), concentration of
   aggregates of size x, and the weight S(t) and number N(t) average sizes
   at time t. The fragmentation of two typical aggregates were studied. The
   first aggregates obtained under conditions of perikinetic
   diffusion-limited aggregation (1 M NaCl and pH 3.0 medium) were
   transferred to aqueous polyelectrolyte solutions at different
   concentrations in the presence of 0.15 M NaCl and at pH 3.0. The second
   aggre gates obtained under conditions of reaction-limited aggregation
   (0.15 M NaCl and pH 3.0 medium) were transferred to aqueous
   polyelectrolyte solutions in the presence of 0.0225 M NaCl and at pH
   3.0. We determined that fragmentation is a very slow process. The size
   distribution of the fragments was self-similar and the variation in the
   number average size N(t) and the weight average size S(t) as a function
   of time followed dynamic scaling laws whose exponents depended on the
   mode of formation and the initial size of the aggregates, as well as on
   the concentration and the molecular weight of the polymer. Using Cheng
   and Redner's theory (Phys. Rev. Lett. 60, 2450 (1988); J. Phys. A: Math
   Gen. 23, 1233 (1990)), we calculated the rate of aggregate breakup,
   which was found to be independent of the initial size of the aggregates
   and of the polyelectrolyte concentration. The mode of aggregate
   formation and the molecular weight of the polymer in the fragmenting
   medium were found to fix the rate of breakup and the fragment size
   distribution. The discrepancies between the rate of aggregate break-up
   and the rates of fragmentation determined from the variation of the
   average sizes were attributed to the existence of a concomitant
   aggregation during fragmentation. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.

AB The adsorption of Suwannee River humic substances (HS) on colloidal-size
   aluminum oxide particles was examined as a function of solution
   chemistry.  The amount of humic acid (HA) or fulvic acid (FA) adsorbed
   decreased with increasing pH for all solutions of constant ionic
   strength.  In NaCl solutions at fixed pH values, the adsorption of HA
   and FA increased with increasing ionic strength.  The presence of Ca2+
   enhanced the adsorption of HA but had little effect on FA.  For
   identical solution conditions, the amount (by mass) of HA adsorbed to
   alumina was always greater than FA.  Adsorption densities for both HA
   and FA showed good agreement with the Langmuir equation, and
   interpretations of adsorption processes were made from the model
   parameters.  For FA, ligand exchange appears to be the dominant
   adsorption reaction for the conditions studied here.  Ligand exchange is
   also a major adsorption reaction for HA; however, other reactions
   contribute to adsorption for some solution compositions.  At high pH,
   cation and water bridging become increasingly important for HA
   adsorption with increasing amounts of Na+ and Ca2+, respectively.  At
   low to neutral pH values, increases in these same two cations make
   hydrophobic bonding more effective.  Calculations of HS carboxyl group
   densities in the adsorbed layer support the proposed adsorption
   reactions.  From the adsorption data it appears that fewer than 3.3
   HS-COO- groups per nm2 can be bound directly as inner-sphere complexes
   by the alumina surface.  We propose that the influence of aqueous
   chemistry on HS adsorption reactions, and therefore on the types of HS
   surface complexes formed, affects the formation and nature of organic
   coatings on mineral surfaces.

AB The adsorption of three humic substances isolated from the River Dodder
   (Eire) and one commercial humic acid (Aldrich) by six minerals was
   studied and found to be influenced by mineral type, the nature of the
   humics and by the solution characteristics. Adsorption was heavily
   pH-dependent, with lower uptake at higher pH values due to increased
   ionization of the humic substances. The amount of humic substances
   adsorbed was in the order: Aldrich humic acid > Dodder humic acid >
   Dodder fulvic acid > Dodder hydrophilic macromolecular acid
   corresponding to a decreasing aromatic carbon content and increasing O/C
   ratio. Desorption experiments showed Aldrich humic acid was the most
   difficult to be desorbed, followed by Dodder humic acid, Dodder fulvic
   acid then Dodder hydrophilic macromolecular acid. Humic uptake was found
   to increase with ionic strength due to the neutralization of charges on
   both mineral surfaces and humic substances, and more importantly, the
   compression of diffuse double layers; this also showed that van der
   Waals attraction is an important part of the interactive forces between
   humic substances and mineral particles. The amount of humic substances
   adsorbed varied with mineral type, particle size and surface area, with
   aluminium oxide having the highest capacity. The effect of temperature
   on humic adsorption was shown to vary with humic type and two types of
   reaction mechanism have been proposed responsible for the humic-clay
   interactions.

AB The adsorption and desorption mechanisms of natural organic matter (NOM)
   on mineral surfaces are not completely understood because of the
   heterogeneity and complexity of NOM and adsorbent surfaces. This study
   was undertaken to elucidate the interaction mechanisms between NOM and
   iron oxide surfaces and to develop a predictive model for NOM adsorption
   and desorption. Results indicated that ligand exchange between
   carboxyl/hydroxyl functional groups of NOM and iron oxide surfaces was
   the dominant interaction mechanism, especially under acidic or slightly
   acidic pH conditions. This conclusion was supported by the measurements
   of heat of adsorption (microcalorimetry), FTIR and C-13 NMR analysis,
   and competitive adsorption between NOM and some specifically adsorbed
   anions. A modified Langmuir model was proposed in which a surface
   excess-dependent affinity parameter was defined to account for a
   decreasing adsorption affinity with surface coverage due to the
   heterogeneity of NOM and adsorbent surfaces. With three adjustable
   parameters, the model is capable of describing a variety of adsorption
   isotherms. A hysteresis coefficient, h, was used to describe the
   hysteretic effect of adsorption reactions that, at h = 0, the reaction
   is completely reversible, whereas at h = 1, the reaction is completely
   irreversible. Fitted values of h for NOM desorption on iron oxide
   surfaces ranged from 0.72 to 0.92, suggesting that the adsorbed NOM was
   very difficult to be desorbed at a given pH and ionic composition. Our
   results imply that a better mechanistic understanding of the interaction
   between NOM and oxide surfaces is needed to improve our predictive
   capabilities in NOM transport and cotransport of contaminants associated
   with NOM or iron oxides.

AB The extent and kinetics of adsorption of a peat-derived humic substance
   (HS) onto a hydrophobic surface (mercury electrode) and a polar mineral
   surface (gamma-Al2O3 colloids) was studied. Adsorption on the
   Hg-electrode was assessed by directly measuring the change of the double
   layer capacitance caused by the adsorption of HS on the electrode
   surface through phase-selective a.c. polarography; the extent of
   adsorption of HS on the gamma-Al2O3-surface was monitored by determining
   the residual HS-concentration in solution.
   On both surfaces, HS is adsorbed strongly over a wide pH-range;
   hydrophobic interaction (i.e., expulsion from solution) prevails at the
   mercury surface while coordinative adsorption (ligand exchange),
   enhanced by hydrophobic effects, is the predominant mechanism at the
   oxide surface. Adsorption kinetics are characterized by an initial fast
   process, where even in dilute solutions (<1 mg HS L(-1)), a high surface
   coverage is attained initially. True adsorption equilibrium however,
   cannot be reached within hours. The slow approach to equilibrium is
   thought to be caused mainly by the polydispersity of HS resulting in
   fractionation processes, where presumably fast-adsorbing low-molecular
   weight compounds are successively displaced from the surface by
   slow-adsorbing compounds of higher molecular weight. Slow molecular
   rearrangements of HS-molecules at the interface cannot be ruled out,
   however.
   Our results suggest that adsorption of humic substances on mineral as
   well as hydrophobic aquatic surfaces may lead to a progressive and
   selective immobilization of certain fractions of humic substances. It is
   probable that the higher-molecular weight fractions accumulate at
   aquatic interfaces, whereas lower-molecular weight fractions, such as
   fulvic acid components, are more likely to remain in solution. This may
   have significant effects on the qualitative composition and reactivity
   of dissolved vs. particulate organic carbon and on the residence time of
   different fractions of humic substances in natural systems. In turn, the
   chemical reactivity of particle surfaces may also be influenced by
   different fractions of adsorbed humic substances.

AB Column filtration experiments, using quartz grains as the bed media,
   were conducted to study the deposition kinetics of hematite particles in
   the presence of three well-characterized humic substances. Two pH
   conditions, 5.2 and 7.4, were selected such that the humic matter was
   adsorbed to an originally positive and negative hematite surface,
   respectively. Background NaCl concentrations ranged from 0.015 to 0.1 M.
   The particle deposition rates, expressed in terms of initial
   experimental attachment efficiencies (alpha(exp)), depended on the
   magnitude of both electrostatic and steric repulsive interaction
   energies. For a given solution chemistry, values of alpha(exp) exhibited
   a strong dependence on the type of the humic matter, while
   electrophoretic mobility measurements were independent of the type of
   surface coating and were solely a function of the pH and NaCl
   concentration. The lowest values of alpha(exp) were obtained for
   particles coated with the largest molecular size humic material at all
   solution conditions. Their low attachment rates were attributed to
   greater steric interaction forces. Attachment efficiencies of hematite
   particles coated with two different fulvic acids were determined. It is
   proposed that differences in the attachment rates are related to
   differences in the surface conformations of the fulvic acids.

AB Size distribution of colloidal quartz and hematite (initial diameter

   Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS) in well-defined laboratory systems.
   Effects on the mean diameter and the size distribution were measured at
   various values of pH (2-12) and ionic strength (0.001-0.7 mol/1) in an
   inert medium (NaClO4). The effect of an aquatic fulvic acid on the
   stability of the colloids was included in the study. In the absence of
   fulvic acid the colloids flocculate at a pH close to pH(zpc) of the
   respective mineral. This increase in mean diameter is due to
   electrostatic interactions. Hematite colloids are also destabilised at a
   pH much below pH(zpc). The quartz colloids are stabilised in the
   presence of fulvic acid.  The hematite/fulvic acid systems are stable at
   high pH, but flocculate at low pH. Increasing ionic strength induces
   agglomeration of the quartz colloids at 0.1 mol/l, independently of the
   presence of fulvic acid (2 mg/1). Hematite is destabilised at 0.02 mg/l
   in the absence of fulvic acid, while in the presence of fulvic acid the
   colloids aggregate at ionic strength >0.07 mol/l.

AB Laboratory and field observations by several investigators indicate that
   natural organic matter (NOM) affects and probably controls the colloidal
   stability of particles in aquatic systems. The enhanced stability of
   particles in aquatic systems containing NOM is a consistent observation
   without a clear cause. In this work, the potential importance of the
   macromolecular nature of NOM was investigated using model systems. A
   mathematical model for the adsorption of linear, flexible
   polyelectrolytes was used to examine the effects of molecular weight,
   pH, and ionic strength on the conformations of these surrogates for NOM
   at interfaces in natural waters. Laboratory experiments involving
   submicron hematite particles, two anionic polyelectrolytes, and an
   aquatic NOM were used to examine the effects of solution composition on
   colloidal stability. Together, the results of the mathematical
   simulations and the laboratory experiments indicate that electrostatic
   effects dominate particle-particle interactions, but that the
   macromolecular nature of NOM can have direct influence under certain
   conditions. At low ionic strength, anionic polyelectrolytes affect the
   coagulation of positively charged particles by altering net surface
   charge in a way similar to specifically adsorbing, multivalent,
   monomeric anions. At high ionic strength (I greater-than-or-equal-to
   0.1), the conformational characteristics of adsorbed polyelectrolytes at
   the solid/water interface directly affect coagulation by expanding the
   effective distance of electrostatic repulsion between approaching
   particles, as well as by altering net surface charge. Non-electrostatic
   steric repulsion plays little or no role in the stabilization of
   hematite particles by the organic macromolecules used in this work.
   Calcium acts to destabilize hematite particles in the presence of the
   organic macromolecules, perhaps through a combination of specific
   chemical and charge effects.
